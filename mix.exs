      # Fresco 0.6 extracted `<Fresco.scroll_strip>` to a separate
      # `fresco_strip` package — PhoenixKit doesn't use scroll_strip
      # so no companion dep needed.
      # Etcher 0.3 dropped its Ecto storage adapter and now persists
      # annotations inside the canvas's extensions map — single bulk
      # `etcher:annotations-changed` event, client-side UUIDv7. Etcher
      # 0.5 added the public `revealShape` Promise + `shapeAt`

      # tile overlay rides Fresco's stage transform so it stays glued to the
      # image. JS hooks lazy-load from jsdelivr pinned to the matching tag.
