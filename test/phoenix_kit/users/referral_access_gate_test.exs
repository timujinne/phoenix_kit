defmodule PhoenixKit.Users.ReferralAccessGateTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Covers the invite-only access gate — `Referrals.access_satisfied?/1` and the
  state it derives that answer from.

  Invite-only used to be enforced only on the password registration form, so
  the same install let anyone in through OAuth or a magic link. Enforcement
  moved to a post-signup gate; these tests pin the parts of it that are easy to
  get subtly wrong and impossible to notice from the outside — an account
  silently admitted, or an operator silently locked out.

  `phoenix_kit_referrals` is not a dependency of core, so the "invite-only is
  actually on" cases register a stub module under the `"referrals"` key. That
  is not a shortcut: the gate deliberately reads *through* the installed
  module, and one of the tests below is about what happens when there isn't one.
