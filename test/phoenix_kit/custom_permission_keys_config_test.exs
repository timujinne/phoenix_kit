defmodule PhoenixKit.CustomPermissionKeysConfigTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Admin tabs have always been declarative; custom permission keys were the odd
  one out, because `register_custom_key/2` touches the database via the Admin
  auto-grant and so has to run after boot. Every host was therefore hand-writing
  an imperative call at the end of its own `Application.start/2`.

  `PhoenixKit.boot/1` now reads them from config. These pin the parsing and the
  fail-loud contract; whether `boot/1` itself is called is the host's business
  (and documented as such).
