defmodule PhoenixKit.Utils.AdminSegmentTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Coverage for the configurable admin segment (`config :phoenix_kit, admin_path:`).

  The feature is a matched pair of rewrites, and the whole design rests on them
  being exact inverses:

    * **emit** — `Routes.apply_admin_segment/1` moves a canonical `/admin...`
      onto the configured segment. Reached by every URL core hands out, and by
      the router's own route table at compile time.
    * **read** — `Routes.canonical_admin_path/1` moves it back, so anything
      comparing an incoming request path against a path written in code sees
      both spelled the same way.

  A test that only exercised the emit half would pass on a build where tab
  highlighting is silently dead, so the round trip is asserted directly and the
  `Tab.matches_path?/2` consequence is asserted on top of it.

  Deliberately plain `ExUnit.Case` for the same reason as
  `PhoenixKit.Utils.SafeDestinationTest`: `DataCase` would stamp
  `@moduletag :integration` and auto-exclude the file on exactly the runs where
  it is most useful. Nothing here needs a database.

  Not `async` — the segment lives in `:persistent_term` (via
  `PhoenixKit.Config.get_admin_path/0`), so a test that flips it is flipping
  global state for the whole node.

  # ── A router compiled under a RENAMED admin segment ────────────────────
  #
  # This is the only assertion that can prove the rename reached the router
  # rather than only the link builders — everything else in this file would
  # pass just as happily against a route table still nailed to `/admin`.
  #
  # Compiled from source inside `setup_all` rather than as a `defmodule` in the
  # file body, and that is load-bearing. `mix test` loads test files with
  # `Kernel.ParallelCompiler`, so a flip in a file BODY overlaps the loading of
  # every other test file — including the ones that compile routers of their
  # own. The segment is cached in `:persistent_term`, so a parallel reader that
  # cached "/backoffice" a moment before this file restored the default pinned
  # it there for the whole run: ~25 unrelated tests failed with 404s on
  # `/phoenix_kit/en/backoffice/...`, none of them anywhere near this feature.
  #
  # `setup_all` runs in the SYNC phase instead — after every async module has
  # finished, with one sync module running at a time — so the flip has the node
  # to itself.
