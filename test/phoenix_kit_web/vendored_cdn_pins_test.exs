defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.VendoredCdnPinsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Every sibling-library JS bundle pinned in `phoenix_kit.js` names the
  release hex resolved.

  The bundles (leaf, fresco, tessera, etcher) are fetched from jsDelivr by
  GitHub tag while their Elixir halves come from hex — and nothing makes the
  two agree except the strings in `phoenix_kit.js`. They drift, and the
  drift is silent by construction: almost everything these libraries add is
  a server<->client contract, so a stale bundle renders identically and
  just stops implementing what the server now expects.

  It has happened twice. Leaf's pin sat two minors behind (v0.3.2 serving
  while hex resolved 0.5.1 — no `{:leaf_flushed, ...}` reply, no dirty
  re-baseline), which is when the leaf-only version of this test was
  written. Then etcher's pin was found THREE minors behind (v0.9.0 serving
  while hex resolved 0.12.0 — none of the selection, snapping, keyboard or
  clipboard work reaching any host), because the test covered only leaf.
  Generalized to every `gh/` pin in the file, with the version resolved
  from the lock, so the next sibling added here is covered the moment its
  pin appears.

  Superseded file name: `leaf_bundle_pin_test.exs`.
