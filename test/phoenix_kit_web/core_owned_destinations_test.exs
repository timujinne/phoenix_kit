defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.CoreOwnedDestinationsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The invariant this branch exists to establish: **core never sends anyone to a
  path it does not own.**

  Three halves, all database-free:

    * the router-level facts the resolver's safety argument rests on — core does
      NOT route `/` or its locale-prefixed twin, and DOES route the two landings
      the chain can terminate at (plus `/dashboard`, still a candidate), in
      every locale shape;
    * behavioral tests that directly invoke the mount functions of the three
      LiveViews that gate post-auth flow and assert the computed destination
      resolves in a core-only router — the check a static scan cannot perform
      because the destination is stored in a variable before being passed to
      `redirect(to: destination)`;
    * behavioral tests on the resolver itself, asserting that every chain
      terminates on a path this router declares. These replaced a pair of
      whole-file regexes over `lib/**/*.ex` that hunted for a literal `to: "/"`:
      a regex can only prove a negative about source text, and it was blind to
      exactly the computed-destination shape above.

  `PhoenixKitWeb.Router` is a real compiled router that calls
  `phoenix_kit_routes()` (documented as "used only for development and
  testing"), so `Phoenix.Router.route_info/4` against it is the oracle for
  "does core own this path".
