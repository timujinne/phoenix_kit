defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaCanvasViewerLabelSyncTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The label half of the media viewer's annotation sync.

  Since Etcher 0.12 the label-bearing kinds (text / callout / dimension)
  collect their text through Etcher's INLINE editor, arriving on the wire as
  `metadata.title` — not through the comment composer, which is what the sync
  was written for. Two silent failure modes are pinned here:

    * a metadata-only change judged "unchanged" (geometry/style/kind-only
      comparison), so the label's DB write was skipped and the text vanished
      on the next open;
    * the wire metadata persisted verbatim, baking the server-injected
      comment preview (`comment_count`, …) into the row.

  `current` in these tests is the CURATED map `load_annotations_for/1`
  produces (title surfaced as `metadata.title`, comment preview injected) —
  the same shape `viewer_annotations` holds. Reading `current.title` as if it
  were a schema struct crashed the LiveView on every label commit.
