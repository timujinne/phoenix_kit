defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.RoutePrecedenceTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Guards the declaration order of the PhoenixKit LiveView surfaces.

  `:locale` is an ordinary path segment. Phoenix.Router has no segment
  constraints — `Phoenix.Router.Scope.push/2` reads only :path, :alias,
  :as, :host, :private, :assigns, :log and :trailing_slash, and silently
  discards anything else — so a `locale: ~r/.../` option on a scope looks
  like a guard, compiles without a warning, and does nothing. The public
  surface therefore contains routes of the shape `/<prefix>/:locale/<lit>`
  that match ANY first segment.

  While the public surface was emitted before the admin one, a module that
  put a public page at `/shop` and its admin page at `/admin/shop` (which
  `phoenix_kit_ecommerce` does) had its admin page swallowed:
  `/<prefix>/admin/shop` bound to `/<prefix>/:locale/shop` with
  `locale = "admin"`. Root-mounted installs were bounced to the public
  storefront; prefixed installs redirected to themselves forever.

  These tests pin the fix from both directions — the mechanism in
  isolation, and the invariant on the real router.

    #     reload — see `lib/phoenix_kit/dashboard/ADMIN_README.md`.
    #   * that session carries `{PhoenixKitWeb.Dashboard.ContextProvider,
    #     :default}`, which halt-redirects a visitor with zero contexts when a
    #     host configures `empty_behavior: {:redirect, path}` — the guaranteed
    #     landing bouncing its own visitor, the exact thing being prevented.
    #   * its pipeline runs `:phoenix_kit_require_authenticated` BEFORE
    #     `:phoenix_kit_locale_validation`, so an anonymous visitor to
    #     `/<prefix>/et/admin` was sent to a login page in the site default
    #     language.
