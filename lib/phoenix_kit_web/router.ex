  phoenix_kit_routes()

  # Test-only: a routable stand-in for a host app's own public LiveView,
  # backing test/phoenix_kit_web/users/auth_crawlers_no_index_test.exs. Needs a
  # real route (not live_isolated/3) because :phoenix_kit_mount_current_scope
  # attaches a :handle_params hook that requires a non-nil socket.router.
  #
  # Known, accepted trade-off: the Hex package doesn't ship test/, so a
  # consumer compiling this dep under MIX_ENV=test (e.g. their own `mix
  # test`) builds this block referencing a PublicHostAppLive module that
  # isn't present for them. This is inert, not a build failure — Phoenix's
  # `live` macro only stores the module as an atom and resolves it at
  # request time, and this router is never mounted by parent apps (see
  # moduledoc above) — but it is a latent dead reference. A dedicated
  # test-only Endpoint+Router pair under test/support/ would avoid it
  # entirely; not worth the extra scaffolding for a single probe route.
