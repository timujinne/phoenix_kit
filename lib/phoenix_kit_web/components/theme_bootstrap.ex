defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Components.ThemeBootstrap do
  @moduledoc """
  The pre-paint theme setup — palettes plus the stamp script — renders in
  `<head>`, before (or with) the stylesheets.

  Every page class had its own first-paint story and most of them flashed:
  the dashboard's `<html>` carried no `data-theme` and applied the saved one
  from a script at the end of `<body>`; the standalone admin hardcoded
  `data-theme="light"` and fixed it up on DOMContentLoaded; the kit's own
  root layout hardcoded light and ran no theme JS at all. A dark-mode user
  got a white flash on the first two and permanent light on the third.

  This component is the one shared answer: the custom-theme `<style>`
  (phoenix-* plus host `:theme_definitions`) plus a synchronous script that
  reads the saved choice, resolves `"system"` from `ThemeConfig.system_pair/0`
  — the CONFIGURED pair, not hardcoded `phoenix-*` names — and stamps
  `data-theme` plus `color-scheme` on `<html>` before the first paint. The
  palettes travel with the stamp: a script-only bootstrap on a host layout
  (or the standalone admin shell) used to paint `phoenix-dark` +
  `color-scheme: dark` over daisyUI's light variables until a later `<style>`
  in the body arrived.

  It also subscribes to the `storage` event, so a theme picked in one tab
  follows into the others.

  Host root layouts can render it too (`PhoenixKitWeb.Components.ThemeBootstrap`
  is public API); a host with its own equivalent script loses nothing by
  keeping it.
