defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.NavTabs do
  @moduledoc """
  Universal tab component for PhoenixKit.

  Supports two modes with identical visual appearance:

  **Navigation tabs** — each tab carries a URL, renders as `<.link>`:

      <.nav_tabs active_tab="general" tabs={[
        %{id: "general", label: "General", icon: "hero-cog-6-tooth", navigate: Routes.path("/admin/settings")},
        %{id: "advanced", label: "Advanced", navigate: Routes.path("/admin/settings/advanced")}
      ]} />

  **Event tabs** — no URL, uses `on_change` via `phx-click`:

      <.nav_tabs active_tab={@active_tab} on_change="switch_tab" tabs={[
        %{id: "oban", label: "Oban Jobs"},
        %{id: "scheduler", label: "Scheduler"}
      ]} />

  **With badges** (works in both modes):

      <.nav_tabs active_tab={@tab} tabs={[
        %{id: "followers", label: "Followers", patch: Routes.path("/connections?tab=followers"), badge: @followers_count},
        %{id: "following", label: "Following", patch: Routes.path("/connections?tab=following"), badge: @following_count}
      ]} />

  ## Tab map keys

  Required: `:id`, `:label`

  Optional: `:icon` (Heroicon name), `:badge` (count/text), `:badge_class`
  (a daisyUI tone such as `"badge-warning"`, which wins over the active-tab
  default), and at most one link key — `:navigate`, `:patch`, or `:path`.

  Every optional key treats `nil` as absent, so the common
  `badge: if(count > 0, do: count)` renders no badge rather than an empty one.

  The link keys mirror `Phoenix.Component.link/1` rather than inventing a
  parallel vocabulary: `:navigate` for a full LiveView navigation, `:patch`
  to stay in the current LiveView (query-param tabs want this — a `:navigate`
  there remounts and loses socket state). Both pass through VERBATIM, again
  like `link/1` — build them with your module's Paths helpers (or
  `Routes.path/1` yourself). `:path` is the legacy
  spelling: the same link KIND as `:navigate`, but with different prefix
  rules — it is the one key the component still runs through
  `Routes.path/1`, because its callers predate the link keys and have
  always passed unprefixed paths. The two are NOT interchangeable: swapping
  `path:` for `navigate:` while keeping an unprefixed value under-prefixes,
  and the reverse double-prefixes. Setting more than one link key raises; a key whose
  value is `nil` counts as absent, so a conditional path is safe.

  A tab with no link key renders as a button and needs `on_change`; without
  it the tab is inert and the component logs a warning rather than raising —
  a dead tab should not take a whole LiveView down. A strip may freely mix
  link tabs and event tabs.

  ## Event payload

  Event tabs dispatch `phx-value-tab`, so handlers match on:

      def handle_event("switch_tab", %{"tab" => id}, socket)

  The key is deliberately not configurable, and deliberately not `value`:
  LiveView's `extractMeta` overwrites `meta.value` with the element's own
  `.value` DOM property, so a `<button>` (whose `.value` is `""`) silently
  delivers an empty string unless a native `value=` attribute is also set.
  Standardising on `tab` removes the trap rather than making it selectable.

  ## Variants

  `variant={:boxed}` (default) is the filled strip used across admin pages.
  `variant={:plain}` drops the frame for tabs that sit inside an
  already-framed container — a filter row inside a picker, say.
  `variant={:border}` is daisyUI's underline look, the convention on
  show-page and settings tab strips.

  It exists because `class` can only ADD to the container: with the frame
  baked in, a caller had no way to take it off, and hand-rolling the markup
  was the only escape. That is how the copies started.
