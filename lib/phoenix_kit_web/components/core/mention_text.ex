defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.MentionText do
  @moduledoc """
  Renders free text that may contain `@` and `#` mentions, resolved for the
  person looking at it.

      <.mention_text text={@comment.content} scope={@phoenix_kit_current_scope} />

  Each mention becomes one of three things, and which one is a permission
  decision made per viewer, at render:

    * **a link** — they may open it, so they get the live title and a real
      deep-link. The title is re-resolved rather than taken from the text,
      so a renamed record reads correctly.

    * **plain text** — it is gone, or its module was uninstalled. They get
      the label the author saw, unlinked. This is the case that justifies
      keeping the label in the text at all.

    * **the title plus a lock** — it exists and they may not open it. The
      sentence still reads as the thing it names; the lock says it isn't
      theirs, and clicking asks the owners for access. No link.

  The third case shows a LIVE title by default, on the view that a record's
  name is rarely the secret — the access is. Installs where the name IS
  sensitive turn on `mentions_redact_titles`, and a forbidden mention then
  falls back to the label the author stored, so a record renamed after the
  fact never shows its new name to someone who cannot open it.

  ## Wiring the request-access click

  The chip pushes `"pk_request_access"` with `type` and `uuid`. Handle it
  yourself, or get the handler and the dialog for free:

      use PhoenixKit.Mentions.Live

  …then render `<.access_request_dialog request={@pk_access_request} />`
  somewhere in the template — the handler only stages the request; the
  dialog is what asks for the note and submits it.

  Without either, the click is inert — the chip still renders and still
  tells the reader why they cannot see the thing.

  ## No JavaScript

  Everything here is server-rendered. The typeahead that *inserts* mentions
  is a progressive enhancement; reading them has never needed JS.
