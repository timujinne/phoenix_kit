  MediaBrowser LiveComponent — embeddable media management UI.

  Provides a full media browser with folder navigation, file upload, search,
  and selection tools. Operates in two modes:

  - **Uncontrolled** (default): all navigation state is owned internally.
    No URL sync.
  - **Controlled** (opt-in): when `on_navigate` is set to a truthy value,
    navigation events (`navigate_folder`, `search`, `clear_search`, `set_page`)
    emit `{PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser, id, {:navigate, params}}`
    to the parent LiveView process instead of mutating local state. The parent
    must call `push_patch` and feed URL params back via `send_update` with a
    `:nav_params` key.

  ## Enabling uploads

  The fastest path is the `Embed` helper — one `use` line gives you
  uploads, the validate-channel stub, and the message delegator:

      defmodule MyAppWeb.MediaPage do
        use MyAppWeb, :live_view
        use PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser.Embed
      end

  Manual setup (if you prefer explicit wiring) is three calls:

      def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
        {:ok, PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser.setup_uploads(socket)}
      end

      def handle_event("validate", _params, socket), do: {:noreply, socket}

      def handle_info({__MODULE__, _, _} = msg, socket) do
        PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser.handle_parent_info(msg, socket)
      end

  ## Usage (uncontrolled)

      <.live_component
        module={PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser}
        id="media-browser"
        phoenix_kit_current_user={@phoenix_kit_current_user}
      />

  ## Picking into a typed slot

  `only_file_type` restricts the browser to one kind for its whole lifetime —
  the listing is filtered to it, the type-filter control is hidden, and an
  off-type upload is refused, so the other kinds are simply not reachable:

      <.live_component
        module={PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser}
        id="audio-picker"
        select_mode
        only_file_type="audio"
        phoenix_kit_current_user={@phoenix_kit_current_user}
      />

  Use it wherever the selection fills a typed field. Offering everything and
  validating afterwards works, but it lets someone choose a PNG for an audio
  slot and only find out on the rejection — and if a consumer forgets that
  re-check, the PNG lands in the field and renders as a dead `<audio>`.

  Values: `image`, `video`, `document`, `audio`, `archive`, `other`.

  ## Usage (controlled — URL-sync driven by parent)

      <.live_component
        module={PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser}
        id="media-browser"
        phoenix_kit_current_user={@phoenix_kit_current_user}
        on_navigate={true}
      />

  The parent LiveView must implement:

      def handle_info({PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser, "media-browser",
                       {:navigate, params}}, socket) do
        # push_patch to update URL, handle_params will send_update back
      end

  ## Required attributes

  - `id` — unique DOM id (required by LiveComponent)

  ## Optional attributes

  - `phoenix_kit_current_user` — logged-in user struct (for upload attribution)
  - `scope_folder_id` — constrain the browser to a virtual root folder
  - `on_navigate` — when truthy, enables controlled mode (URL-sync via parent)
  - `admin` — clicking a file always opens the in-place modal viewer
    (image / video / PDF / icon + metadata + Download + prev/next
    navigation). When `true`, the viewer sidebar additionally shows an
    "Open details page" button linking to `/admin/media/:uuid`, and
    rotations made in the viewer persist to the file row. Bulk-select is
    still reachable via the toolbar's Select button — once `select_mode`
    is on, clicks toggle selection instead of opening the modal.
