defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Users.ConfirmationInstructions do
  @moduledoc """
  LiveView for resending email confirmation instructions.

  Allows users to request a new confirmation email if they didn't receive
  the original or if the link expired. Only sends if the account exists
  and is not already confirmed.

  This page is also where the authentication gates park logged-in users
  whose email is not yet confirmed (when `require_email_confirmation` is
  on), so it moves them along as soon as confirmation happens:

  - On mount, an already-confirmed user is redirected onward immediately —
    covers a confirmation done elsewhere (or directly in the DB) followed
    by a refresh, since the user is reloaded from the DB on every mount.
  - While parked, the LiveView listens on this user's own confirmation topic
    for `{:user_confirmed, user}` (broadcast by both the email-link flow and
    the admin confirm action) and redirects onward live, no refresh needed —
    e.g. when the user clicks the emailed link in another tab. It is a
    per-user topic, not the site-wide admin users feed, so a parked
    non-admin never receives other users' structs.

  "Onward" is `?return_to=` (stashed by the gate that parked them), then
  the session's `user_return_to`, then the `after_login_path` setting.
