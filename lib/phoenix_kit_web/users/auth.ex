  Authentication and authorization plugs for PhoenixKit user management.

  This module provides plugs and functions for handling user authentication,
  session management, and access control in Phoenix applications using PhoenixKit.

  ## Key Features

  - User authentication with email and password
  - Remember me functionality with secure cookies
  - Session-based authentication
  - Route protection and access control
  - Module-level permission enforcement via on_mount hooks
  - Integration with Phoenix LiveView on_mount callbacks

  ## on_mount Hooks

  - `:phoenix_kit_ensure_admin` — Requires Owner/Admin role, or a custom role
    with at least one permission. Every role is then checked against the
    permission key mapped to the current admin view: Owner passes because its
    scope holds every key by construction; Admin holds keys as real,
    Owner-revocable rows (seeded/auto-granted by default). Disabled modules
    block everyone. Views that resolve to no permission key allow only a scope
    holding every enabled permission — role-agnostic, so a named Admin whose
    keys an Owner has partially revoked is denied too. The first mount of such a
    view logs a warning, whoever mounts it, so the missing mapping surfaces
    before a colleague hits the 403.
  - `:phoenix_kit_ensure_module_access` — Checks that the feature module is
    permitted for the scope and (for custom roles) enabled.

  ## Usage

  The plugs in this module are automatically configured when using
  `PhoenixKitWeb.Integration.phoenix_kit_routes/0` macro in your router.

  Logs the user in.

  It renews the session ID and clears the whole session
  to avoid fixation attacks. See the renew_session
  function to customize this behaviour.

  It also sets a `:live_socket_id` key in the session,
  so LiveView sessions are identified and automatically
  disconnected on log out. The line can be safely removed
  if you are not using LiveView.

  ## Session Fingerprinting

  When session fingerprinting is enabled, this function captures the user's
  IP address and user agent to create a session fingerprint. This helps
  detect session hijacking attempts.

      there's no user_token or no matching user.

    * `:phoenix_kit_mount_current_scope` - Assigns both phoenix_kit_current_user

      structured access to authentication state.

    * `:phoenix_kit_ensure_authenticated` - Authenticates the user from the session,
      and assigns the phoenix_kit_current_user to socket assigns based
      on user_token.
      Redirects to login page if there's no logged user.

    * `:phoenix_kit_ensure_authenticated_scope` - Authenticates the user via scope system,
      assigns both phoenix_kit_current_user and phoenix_kit_current_scope.

    * `:phoenix_kit_ensure_owner` - Ensures the user has owner role,
      and redirects to the home page if not.

    * `:phoenix_kit_ensure_admin` - Ensures the user has admin or owner role,
      and redirects to the home page if not.
      Redirects to login page if there's no logged user.

    * `:phoenix_kit_redirect_if_user_is_authenticated` - Authenticates the user from the session.
      Redirects to signed_in_path if there's a logged user.

    * `:phoenix_kit_redirect_if_authenticated_scope` - Checks authentication via scope system.
      Redirects to signed_in_path if there's a logged user.

  ## Examples

  Use the `on_mount` lifecycle macro in LiveViews to mount or authenticate
  the current_user:

      defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.PageLive do
        use PhoenixKitWeb, :live_view

        on_mount {PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth, :phoenix_kit_mount_current_user}
        ...
      end

  Or use the scope system for better encapsulation:

      defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.PageLive do
        use PhoenixKitWeb, :live_view

        on_mount {PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth, :phoenix_kit_mount_current_scope}
        ...
      end

  Or use the `live_session` of your router to invoke the on_mount callback:

      live_session :authenticated, on_mount: [{PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth, :phoenix_kit_ensure_authenticated_scope}] do
        live "/profile", ProfileLive, :index
      end

  Whether `view` is the guaranteed landing — the one admin LiveView that

  That view is `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Dashboard`, the `/admin` index. It is the
  terminal of `PhoenixKit.Utils.Routes.safe_destination/2`: the page core
  promises any signed-in visitor can be redirected to. A terminal that rejects
  its own visitor is an infinite redirect rather than a fallback, so the gate
  has to admit them — and the page is built for it, gating every operator block
  behind `can_access_admin_view?/2` and showing a permission-less visitor the
  welcome block and nothing else.

  Admission is NOT unconditional: authentication, the account gate (email
  confirmation, maintenance mode, blocked accounts) and the locale hook all run
  first, exactly as for any other admin view. Only the admin-area gate and the
  per-view permission check are skipped.

  # Which arm of `:phoenix_kit_ensure_admin` a visitor takes once authentication
  # and the account gate have passed. Pure — no socket, no flash, no redirect —
  # so the branch ORDER, which is the load-bearing part, is unit-testable
  # without a database. The hook maps each atom to its side effects and nothing
  # else.
  #
  #   * `:landing` — the `/admin` index, for ANY authenticated visitor. It is
  #     the terminal of `PhoenixKit.Utils.Routes.safe_destination/2`, the page
  #     core promises a signed-in visitor can be redirected to, and a terminal
  #     that bounces its own visitor is an infinite redirect rather than a
  #     fallback.
  #   * `:enforce_view` — every other admin view, for a scope that clears the
  #     admin-area gate: `enforce_admin_view_permission/2` then applies the
  #     per-view permission exactly as before.
  #   * `:deny` — no admin rights, and not the landing.
  #
  # The order is not interchangeable. `Scope.can_access_admin_area?/1` is true
  # for any holder of a single permission, but the landing view maps to the
  # `"dashboard"` key — so checking the admin area first would send a client
  # holding only `client_portal` into `:enforce_view`, which would refuse them
  # the very page the resolver had just guaranteed. Landing is asked first, and
  # is the only view for which either permission check is skipped.
  #
  # The landing branch is a PERMISSION exemption, never an authentication one,
  # and it says so itself rather than resting on call-site ordering. Today
  # `require_authenticated_live/2` runs first in the `with`, so an unauthenticated
  # scope can never reach here — but a future caller that forgets, or a host
  # calling this predicate to decide whether to render a link, would otherwise
  # be told the landing is open to nobody-in-particular. `scope_refresh_decision/4`
  # defends its own landing branch the same way, for the same reason.
  #
  # This is a GATE exception, deliberately not a route one: the `/admin` route
  # stays in `live_session :phoenix_kit_admin` with every other `/admin/*` page.
  # Moving it to another live_session would admit the same visitors and cost a
  # full page reload on every navigation into and out of the admin area
  # (LiveView cannot live-navigate across live_sessions — see
  # `lib/phoenix_kit/dashboard/ADMIN_README.md`), while subjecting the
  # guaranteed landing to that session's own hooks, which are free to halt and
  # redirect. A gate exception cannot drift that way.

  # the branches with literal scopes, without LiveView mounting machinery. Not

  Reconstructs and assigns the current user + scope on an **embedded**
  LiveView mount from a host-supplied `session["current_user_uuid"]`.

  A LiveView rendered via `live_render/3` mounts with
  `:not_mounted_at_router`, so it never runs a router `live_session`'s
  `on_mount` hook (e.g. `:phoenix_kit_ensure_admin`) — leaving
  `:phoenix_kit_current_scope` / `:phoenix_kit_current_user` absent, which
  blinds any user-aware embedded UI (comment composers, activity-actor
  attribution). The host bridges identity across the `live_render`
  process boundary by passing its own authenticated user's UUID as
  `session["current_user_uuid"]` — a **string**, never the `%User{}`
  struct (a signed-but-not-encrypted `live_render` session would expose
  it to the client). This helper reloads that user and assigns both
  `:phoenix_kit_current_user` and `:phoenix_kit_current_scope`.

    * No-op when `:phoenix_kit_current_scope` is already assigned (router
      mount — the `on_mount` hook ran, before `mount/3`). Never clobbers
      the canonical scope.
    * An active user → assigns it + `Scope.for_user(user)`.
    * Absent / unknown / inactive uuid, or a transient DB error →
      anonymous (`nil` user + `Scope.for_user(nil)`), never raising.

  > This reconstructs **identity** (audit, comment authorship), not
  > **authorization** — it performs no role check. The UUID must come
  > from the host's trusted server-side scope, never request params; and
  > a host embedding an admin LiveView must gate the embedding page
  > itself (the `on_mount` admin gate does not run for embeds).

  #   * `:evict_admin_area` — held admin access, holds none now, and is NOT on

  # page core guarantees them — and toward a destination whose terminal is that
  # same page. It is the bounce the resolver asserts cannot happen, so it must
  # not happen here either. Every other admin page evicts exactly as before; the
  # landing instead recomputes its own gates in place
  # (`PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Dashboard.Overview.assign_scope_gates/1`), so the
  # demoted visitor keeps the page and loses the operator content on it.
  #
  # The exemption is NOT an authentication exemption, exactly as it is not one
  # at the mount gate: `require_authenticated_live/2` runs before
  # `admin_gate_decision/2` there, and here the scope must still be
  # authenticated to keep the page. A scope that came back unauthenticated means
  # the user row is gone from under the socket, and the landing is no more
  # theirs than any other page.

  # `enforce_admin_view_permission/2`, so `:phoenix_kit_current_module_key` is

  # is a consequence, not a guarantee; the first branch states the exemption.

  @doc """
  Whether `scope` may open the admin LiveView `view_module` — the SAME decision
  `:phoenix_kit_ensure_admin` enforces on mount, exposed as a pure boolean.

  Use it to decide whether to *render* a link, card or nav entry pointing at an
  admin view. "A card is visible iff the visitor can open what it links to"
  then holds by construction: both the card and its destination route through
  this one function, so the two cannot drift.

  Pure — no flash, no redirect, no logging. The on_mount hook keeps those side
  effects (including the one-time "unmapped admin view" warning) and asks this
  same decision for the verdict.

  ## The decision, branch by branch

  1. **Admin-area gate** — `Scope.can_access_admin_area?/1` must hold (Owner,
     Admin, or any holder of at least one permission). Every `/admin` page
     mounts through `:phoenix_kit_ensure_admin`, which bounces a failing scope
     before any per-view check — every page but the landing, which is the one
     deliberate difference between this function and the gate (see below). So a
     card must respect it too: a `nil` scope, and an authenticated user with no
     permissions at all, stop here.
  2. **Personal admin views** — the views in `@personal_admin_views` (your own
     notification inbox / preferences) show a user their OWN data rather than
     granting an administrative capability, so branch 1 is the whole gate.
  3. **Mapped view** — `permission_key_for_admin_view/1` resolved a key:
     * the module behind the key must be enabled
       (`PhoenixKit.Users.Permissions.feature_enabled?/1`) — a disabled module
       is blocked for EVERYONE, Owner included;
     * a dotted SUB-permission key is checked with `Scope.can?/2` (which also
       requires the base key — a raw sub-key without its base is an orphan);
       a flat key with `Scope.has_module_access?/2`.
  4. **Unmapped view** — the key resolved to `nil`: allowed ONLY for a scope
     that holds every enabled permission (`Scope.holds_all_enabled_permissions?/1`).
     This is the fail-CLOSED branch, and it is role-agnostic: Owner passes (it
     holds every key by construction), so does the `"*"` superadmin key and any
     role granted the whole operator baseline; a partially-revoked Admin or a
     narrow custom role does not. Hiding such a card from everyone but a
     full-access scope is exactly right — anyone else is redirected on arrival.

  What this deliberately does NOT answer: authentication, email confirmation
  and the account gate (`require_authenticated_live/2` and `live_account_gate/2`
  run earlier in the hook). Those bounce a visitor before any view-permission
  question is asked; a page deciding what to render has already passed them.

  ## The one view where this is stricter than the mount gate

  `landing_view?/1` — the `/admin` index — is admitted by
  `:phoenix_kit_ensure_admin` for EVERY authenticated visitor, because it is the
  destination `PhoenixKit.Utils.Routes.safe_destination/2` guarantees. This
  function still answers `false` for a scope that fails branch 1, and that is
  deliberate: the landing is somewhere a visitor is *sent*, not somewhere a menu
  should *offer* them. A permission-less visitor who lands there is greeted and
  shown no navigation at all
  (`PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Dashboard.AdminSidebar.reachable_tabs/2` returns
  `[]` for exactly the same scopes), so answering `true` would render a link to
  a page they are already on, inside a shell built for operators.

  Every other view answers identically here and at the gate, which is what makes
  "a card is visible iff its destination admits you" true — a visible card is
  never a redirect, and the only page that admits more than it advertises is the
  one no card points at.

  Validates and sets the locale for the current request.

  This function is called as a plug in the router to validate locale codes in the URL path.
  It implements PhoenixKit's simplified URL architecture:

  - URLs use base language codes (en, es, fr) for simplicity
  - Full dialect codes (en-US, es-MX) are redirected to base codes (301)
  - User preferences determine which dialect variant to use for translations
  - Translation system uses full dialect codes internally

  ## Data Flow

  1. Check if URL contains full dialect code → redirect to base
  2. Validate base code exists in predefined language list
  3. Resolve to full dialect using user preference or default mapping
  4. Set Gettext to full dialect for translations
  5. Store both base code (for URLs) and full dialect (for translations)

  ## Examples

      # Base code in URL (preferred format)
      conn = validate_and_set_locale(conn, [])
      # Sets: current_locale_base="en", current_locale="en-US"

      # Full dialect in URL (legacy/bookmarks)
      conn = validate_and_set_locale(%{path_params: %{"locale" => "en-US"}}, [])
      # Redirects 301 to: /en/...

  # Rebuild the request path with the mis-captured locale segment removed,

  #
  # `conn.request_path` includes the PhoenixKit mount prefix
  # ("/phoenix_kit/admin/shop"), while `locale` is the segment that
  # follows it — so the prefix has to be skipped before dropping the
  # segment, and re-attached afterwards. Returns `:error` when the path
  # does not have the expected `<prefix>/<locale>/...` shape, so callers
  # can decline to redirect rather than bounce the request at itself.
  #
  # Two subtleties, both of which produced wrong URLs when this was first
  # written against `path_info` alone:
  #
  #   * **`script_name`.** `conn.path_info` is router-relative; a router
  #     reached through `Plug.forward` (a `/tenant` mount, say) carries
  #     the mount segments in `conn.script_name` instead. Rebuilding from
  #     `path_info` only would emit `/phoenix_kit/shop` for a request to
  #     `/tenant/phoenix_kit/api/shop` — a redirect straight out of the
  #     mount. The old `request_path`-based code got this right by
  #     accident, so it has to be restored explicitly.
  #
  #   * **percent-encoding.** Phoenix matches routes against a DECODED
  #     copy of the path (`Phoenix.Router.call/2` does
  #     `Enum.map(path_info, &URI.decode/1)` before `__match_route__`),
  #     but leaves `conn.path_info` encoded. So `/phoenix_kit/%61pi/shop`
  #     binds `path_params["locale"] == "api"` while `path_info` still
  #     holds `"%61pi"`, and a raw comparison silently misses. Compare
  #     decoded segments; emit the RAW ones, so the redirect target keeps

  #      `conn.status || 302` and ignores an `:status` option entirely,
  #      so the `status: 301` that used to sit on this call was dead.
  #   2. A real 301 here would be a bug. Which language is "default" is a
  #      runtime setting an admin can change; browsers and crawlers cache
  #      301s ~forever, so flipping the default from en to et would leave
  #      clients permanently redirecting `/en/...` away from a locale that
  #      had become a legitimate URL. The accidental 302 was the correct
  #      behaviour all along.

  Redirects full dialect code URLs to base language URLs.

  This function handles backward compatibility by redirecting old URLs with
  full dialect codes (en-US, es-MX) to the new simplified base code URLs (en, es).

  Sends a **302**. The docs here used to promise a 301, and the call passed
  `status: 301` — but `Phoenix.Controller.redirect/2` sends
  `conn.status || 302` and ignores an `:status` option, so no 301 was ever
  emitted. The option has been removed rather than made real: a cached
  permanent redirect off a dialect code is hard to walk back if the
  dialect set changes, and nothing here needs permanence. Use
  `put_status(:moved_permanently)` before `redirect/2` if that ever changes.

  ## Examples

      iex> redirect_to_base_locale(conn, "en-US")
      # /phoenix_kit/en-US/admin → /phoenix_kit/en/admin

      iex> redirect_to_base_locale(conn, "es-MX")
      # /phoenix_kit/es-MX/users?page=2 → /phoenix_kit/es/users?page=2

  ## Preservation

  - Query parameters preserved (via `with_query_string/2` — they were not,
    before: this rebuilds a path, and `conn.request_path` stops at the "?")
  - Request method unchanged (GET → GET)
  - Full path structure maintained

  URL fragments are NOT preserved, and cannot be: a fragment never leaves
  the browser, so the server has nothing to copy. The client re-applies
  its own fragment to the `Location` it follows.

  ## Notes

  - Halts conn pipeline (no further processing)
  - Logged for monitoring migration patterns
