defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Live.UrlState do
  @moduledoc """
  URL-backed list state for LiveView index pages — search, filters, sort, page.

  A list screen's state belongs in the address bar: the result is then a real
  URL that can be pasted to a colleague, bookmarked, and reproduced by a reload,
  and the browser Back button returns to the previous query instead of leaving
  the page.

  Declare the state, handle one callback, and push changes:

      defmodule MyAppWeb.UsersLive do
        use MyAppWeb, :live_view

        use PhoenixKitWeb.Live.UrlState,
          params: [
            search_query: [default: "", url_key: "q", alias: "search"],
            filter_role:  [default: "all", url_key: "role"],
            sort_by:      [default: "inserted_at", in: ~w(inserted_at email)],
            sort_dir:     [default: :desc, cast: :atom, in: [:asc, :desc]],
            page:         [default: 1, cast: :integer, min: 1]
          ]

        def handle_url_state(state, socket) do
          assign(socket, :users, Users.list(state))
        end

        def handle_event("search", %{"search" => q}, socket) do
          {:noreply, push_url_state(socket, [search_query: q], replace: true)}
        end
      end

  ## Parameter spec

  Each entry is `assign_name: opts`. The key is the socket assign the value
  lands in, so adopting an existing LiveView is a matter of listing the assigns
  it already has — its template does not change.

    * `:default` — required. The value used when the key is absent or invalid.
      Values equal to the default are **omitted from the query string**, so an
      unfiltered list is `/admin/users`, not `/admin/users?q=&role=all&page=1`.
    * `:url_key` — the query-string key. Defaults to the assign name. Use it
      when the assign is `:search_query` but the URL should read `?q=`.
    * `:alias` — an additional key accepted when **reading**, never written.
      Lets a screen that already published `?search=` links converge on `?q=`
      without breaking them. Accepts a string or a list of strings.
    * `:cast` — `:string` (default), `:integer`, `:atom` or `:boolean`.
    * `:in` — allowed values. Anything else falls back to the default.
      **Required for `cast: :atom`**: the incoming string is matched against
      this list, so no atom is ever created from user input.
    * `:min` / `:max` — bounds for `cast: :integer`. Out-of-range falls back to
      the default. `:max` defaults to 1_000_000 for integers: an unbounded page
      number out of the URL overflows PostgreSQL's `bigint` once it reaches
      `OFFSET`, turning a crafted link into a 500.

  Unknown query keys are preserved across patches, so an unrelated param is not
  dropped when a filter changes — the media selector is opened with
  `?return_to=…&mode=single`, and both survive a search.

  ## Options

    * `:params` — the spec above. Required.
    * `:dead_render` — `:call` (default) runs `handle_url_state/2` on the
      disconnected render as well, so the first paint already carries the list.
      This is what a `mount/3` that loads its data already does, which is why it
      is the default: adopting the module does not change what the user sees.
      `:skip` runs the callback only once the socket is connected, halving the
      queries per page load — worth it on a heavy list, wrong on a page that
      must serve content to crawlers. ⚠ With `:skip` the callback has not run
      when the disconnected render happens, so **any assign the callback sets
      does not exist yet**: the template must tolerate that (`@users || []`),
      or mount must seed a placeholder. Otherwise the dead render raises rather
      than merely painting empty.
    * `:page_param` — the assign reset whenever another parameter changes.
      Defaults to `:page` when the spec declares it; `false` disables the reset.

  ## Writing state

  `push_url_state/3` merges the changes, resets the page parameter unless the
  page itself was what changed, drops defaults, and patches **the path the
  LiveView is currently on** — captured from the live `uri`, not rebuilt from a
  literal. A screen reachable at more than one route (a sub-tab such as
  `/orders/:id/edit/files`) therefore stays where it is, and the locale segment
  survives.

  Pass `replace: true` for continuous input. A debounced search box otherwise
  writes one history entry per pause in typing, and Back walks the query
  backwards a few characters at a time instead of leaving the page. Discrete
  actions — picking a filter, sorting, changing page — should push a real entry.

  For links rather than events (`<.pagination>`, `<.link patch=…>`), build the
  target with `url_state_path/2`.

  ## `:patch` is router-only; embeddable LiveViews need `:history`

  The default, `mode: :patch`, makes a LiveView **impossible to embed with
  `live_render/3`**. The two requirements are mutually exclusive in Phoenix
  LiveView itself:

    * `push_patch` from a root LiveView reaches
      `sync_handle_params_with_live_redirect/5`, which invokes
      `view.handle_params/3` unconditionally — the 4-arity
      `Utils.call_handle_params!` defaults `exported?` to `true`. So
      `handle_params/3` must be exported.
    * On an embedded mount (`socket.root_pid != self()`),
      `maybe_call_mount_handle_params/4` sees `any? = callbacks? or exported?`
      and takes the branch that raises through `Route.live_link_info!`. Merely
      exporting `handle_params/3` — whatever its body — makes a LiveView
      un-embeddable.

  One requires exactly what the other forbids. `mode: :history` sidesteps both
  by never touching `handle_params` at all: the browser owns the URL, and the
  LiveView talks to it through a JS hook.

      use PhoenixKitWeb.Live.UrlState,
        mode: :history,
        params: [search: [default: "", url_key: "q"]]

  The template must render the hook's element once:

      <.url_state_sync mode={:history} />

  What changes in `:history` mode:

    * `push_url_state/3` applies the state itself and pushes the new query to
      the client, which rewrites the address bar (`pushState`, or
      `replaceState` when you pass `replace: true`). There is no round trip.
    * Back and Forward arrive as a `popstate` report from the hook, decoded the
      same way a patch would be.
    * **The LiveView keeps loading its list in `mount/3`.** There is no
      `handle_params` to hang the first call on, so `handle_url_state/2` serves
      changes only. Declared params are still assigned before `mount/3` runs,
      so a router-mounted LiveView loads the right thing immediately.
    * On an embedded mount, params arrive as `:not_mounted_at_router`, so
      `mount/3` sees the defaults and the hook corrects it on connect — one
      extra load, and only when the URL actually carried state.
    * `url_state_path/2` and `<.link patch=…>` do **not** apply — there is no
      router to patch against. Drive everything through events.
    * Only the query is exchanged; the path stays client-side, because an
      embedded LiveView does not know what page it is on. One synced LiveView
      per page — two would fight over the same query keys.

  In `:patch` mode, a LiveView that already defines its own `handle_params/3`
  keeps it and the state hook composes alongside — both run. Only one without
  it gets the stub that `push_patch` requires; in `:history` mode the stub is
  deliberately never injected.

  ## Setting a declared param outside an event

  Prefer `push_url_state/3` so the address bar changes with the state. But a
  plain `assign/3` on a declared param is safe: the next patch reads its merge
  base back from the assigns, so the freshest value wins and the URL catches
  up rather than resurrecting what was superseded.

  This matters for screens that adjust their own state as a side effect — a
  list re-picking its sort column after the current one is hidden, say. Before
  this was handled, such a reset left the old column in the URL, the next
  search re-applied it, and a reload sorted by a column that was no longer
  visible.

  ## `@impl` is all-or-nothing

  Elixir demands `@impl` on *every* callback of a module that uses it on any
  one of them, so match whatever the LiveView already does:

    * **Annotates nothing** (core's own LiveViews) — leave `handle_url_state/2`
      bare. Adding `@impl` here turns `mount/3`, `handle_event/3` and friends
      into warnings, which `mix precommit` compiles as errors.
    * **Annotates its callbacks** (Andi's LiveViews) — annotate
      `handle_url_state/2` too, *and* define an explicit
      `@impl true def handle_params(_params, _uri, socket), do: {:noreply, socket}`.
      The stub injected below carries no `@impl`, so letting it be injected into
      an annotating module is itself a warning.
