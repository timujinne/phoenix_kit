defmodule PhoenixKit.Users.Referrals do
  @moduledoc """
  Core-side runtime bridge to the optional `phoenix_kit_referrals` package.

  The referral-codes feature lives in the standalone `phoenix_kit_referrals`
  module. Core has **no compile-time dependency** on it — this facade resolves
  the installed module at runtime by its `PhoenixKit.Module` key (`"referrals"`)
  via `PhoenixKit.ModuleRegistry` and dispatches through it.

  When the package isn't installed (or doesn't export a given function) every
  call degrades safely: the system reads as disabled, lookups return `nil`, and
  `use_code/2` is a no-op. That lets the registration / OAuth / magic-link flows
  treat referrals as optional — with the module absent, the referral field never
  appears and nothing is recorded.

  The function surface here mirrors exactly what the signup flows call, so those
  call sites only had to swap their alias to this module.

  ## Invite-only access gate

  With `referral_codes_required` on, a referral code is supposed to be the only
  way in. Enforcing that at each *creation* path does not work: OAuth and
  magic-link signups can be started from URLs that never pass through the
  registration form, and blocking them there produces dead ends rather than
  admission control.

  So enforcement is a **post-signup access gate**. An account may be created by
  any means; until it is *satisfied* it can reach nothing but
  `/users/referral` (where a code admits it) and log-out. `access_satisfied?/1`
  is the single predicate, called from the same choke points that enforce email
  confirmation — see `PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth`.

  An account is satisfied when any of these holds:

  1. It has `custom_fields["referral_satisfied_at"]` — written by
     `mark_satisfied/2` when a code is used at signup, entered on the parked
     screen, or accepted as part of an organization invitation.
  2. It was created before invite-only took effect and
     `referral_grandfather_existing` is on (the default). See below.
  3. It holds every enabled permission (`Scope.holds_all_enabled_permissions?/1`).
     This is a **hard exemption, independent of the grandfather setting** — an
     operator who turns grandfathering off on an install whose codes are all
     spent would otherwise lock themselves out with no way back in. It is keyed
     on permissions rather than a role name because that is what the rest of the
     admin gate uses, and Owner satisfies it by construction.
  4. A pending, unexpired organization invitation is addressed to its email.
     Invitations are email-bound, so this makes org admins de-facto admission
     issuers on purpose — without it the "you were invited" banner on the
     registration page is a dead end under invite-only.

  ### Why not `confirmed_at`

  The satisfied flag is deliberately independent of email confirmation. OAuth
  auto-confirms (`PhoenixKit.Users.OAuth`), so a gate keyed on `confirmed_at`
  would open for exactly the path it most needs to close.

  ### Grandfathering

  `referral_required_enabled_at` records when invite-only took effect, and users
  created before it are grandfathered while `referral_grandfather_existing`
  (default `true`) is on. Core stamps and clears that setting itself, from
  `access_required?/0`, rather than relying on the referrals admin toggle — that
  way it stays correct whoever flips the switch, including an older
  `phoenix_kit_referrals` that knows nothing about the gate. Turning invite-only
  off clears the stamp, so switching it on again grandfathers everyone admitted
  in between.

  ### If the package is uninstalled

  The gate requires `enabled?/0`, which goes through the installed module. With
  the package gone there is no way to *validate* a code, so gating on a
  left-behind `referral_codes_required` row would park every non-exempt user
  permanently.

  Validates a referral code for a signup attempt.

  Shared by every signup surface so the rules cannot drift apart — the password
  and magic-link forms previously carried byte-identical private copies.

  ## Options

  - `:enabled?` / `:required?` — from `get_config/0` (required)
  - `:context` — `:change` while the user types, `:submit` on the final attempt
  - `:ip_address` — used to rate-limit code checking; omit and no limit applies

  ## Why `:context` matters

  On `:change`, **nothing is rejected**. Validation runs on every keystroke
  anywhere in the form, so treating blank-and-required as invalid made "Referral
  code is required" appear while the user was still typing their email — before
  they had reached the field. `:submit` enforces presence.

  A typed code is not checked on change either, which reverses an earlier
  decision that a touched field was fair to complain about. Two reasons pointing
  the same way: checking per keystroke hands an attacker a far faster oracle
  than the submit button does, and it spends one rate-limit token per character,
  so a real person typing an eight-character code and fixing a typo can exhaust
  their own budget while holding a good code.

  ## Why rejections are indistinguishable

  Every failure returns the same message. Separate strings for
  missing / inactive / expired / limit-reached confirmed which guesses named a
  real code. The specific reason is logged at debug level for operators.
