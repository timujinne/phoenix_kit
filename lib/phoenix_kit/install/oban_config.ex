    Ensure the Lifeline plugin exists in an existing `config :app, Oban`
    block's `plugins:` list, adding it if missing.

    Rescues a job orphaned in `:executing` by a hard crash (BEAM `kill -9`,
    OOM, node failure) back to `:available` so it runs again — without it,
    an orphaned job sits stuck in `:executing` forever. That's more than a
    stalled retry: for a unique worker whose unique `states:` includes
    `:executing` (a self-scheduling chain deduping against its own
    in-flight run is a common pattern — see `phoenix_kit_emails`' pollers),
    an orphan permanently blocks every future insert for that worker too,
    not just the one crashed job.

    `rescue_after` is Oban's default of 60 minutes rather than anything
    more aggressive, and it must stay above the host's longest-running
    job. Lifeline rescues purely by elapsed time — it never checks whether
    the node is still alive — so a job that legitimately runs past
    `rescue_after` is flipped back to `:available` (or `:discarded`, if its
    attempts are exhausted) while the original process is still working,
    and re-executes concurrently. PhoenixKit's longest declared worker
    timeout is 30 minutes (`Storage.Workers.SyncFilesJob`); workers with no
    `timeout/1` callback have no bound at all, which is the case the margin
    is really protecting.

    Public (not `defp`, unlike the sibling `ensure_*_queue/2` helpers)
    specifically so this can be unit-tested directly against plain content
    strings, the same way `oban_block_missing_prefix?/1` is — no live
    Igniter/Mix context needed.

    Adds Oban to the parent application's supervision tree.

    This function ensures that Oban starts automatically when the application starts,

    - AFTER PhoenixKit.Supervisor (PhoenixKit services available)
    - BEFORE Endpoint (Oban ready before HTTP requests)

    Oban MUST start AFTER PhoenixKit.Supervisor because PhoenixKit.Supervisor
    depends on Repo, and Oban also depends on Repo. The correct order is:
    1. Repo (database connection)
    2. PhoenixKit.Supervisor (uses Repo for Settings)
    3. Oban (uses Repo for job persistence)
