  Ensures every atom in `compiler_names` is present in the host's `mix.exs`
  `project/0` `:compilers` list — in ONE `Igniter.Project.MixProject.update/4`
  call across every compiler PhoenixKit registers.

  This must be a single call spanning all of them, not one call per compiler.
  `Igniter.Code.List.prepend_new_to_list/2` only understands a literal list
  AST. Registering against an absent `:compilers` key has to produce `atoms
  ++ Mix.compilers()` (a `++` call, not a literal list — `Mix.compilers()` is
  a live call that can't be flattened at install time). A SECOND, separate
  `Igniter.Project.MixProject.update/4` call touching the same key then lands
  on that `++` node instead of a list, and `prepend_new_to_list/2` silently
  fails into a `{:warning, ...}` that's easy to miss in the wall of `mix
  phoenix_kit.update`/`mix phoenix_kit.install` output — so the second
  compiler never actually gets registered even though the run reports
  success. This is not hypothetical: it's exactly how a production host ended
  up with `:phoenix_kit_css_sources` registered (added first) but
  `:phoenix_kit_js_sources` silently missing (added second, in a separate
  call) across many `phoenix_kit.update` runs — so PhoenixKit's own JS hook
  fixes never reached the browser.

  Also repairs a `:compilers` value an affected host is already stuck with in
  that broken `[some_atom] ++ Mix.compilers()` shape: descends into the
  literal list on the left of `++` and prepends there instead of bailing.

  Checks the current installation status for a given prefix.

  Returns one of:
  - `{:not_installed}` - the database is reachable and has no PhoenixKit install at the prefix
  - `{:current_version, version}` - PhoenixKit is installed with given version
  - `{:unknown_version}` - installed, but the version comment is missing or
    unreadable. Distinct from both of the above **because both of them route a
    caller somewhere that writes**: "not installed" to a fresh install, and a
    fabricated low version to the 1.7.x bridge, whose backfill invents uuids for
    still-NULL tracked columns and then deletes the rows that match no user.
    Callers must surface this and stop.
  - `{:unreachable, reason}` - the database cannot be queried, so the install
    state is UNKNOWN — callers must not treat this as "not installed"

  on purpose. `{:unknown_version}` was added after the other three, and the one
