defmodule PhoenixKit.Mentions.Users do
  @moduledoc """
  The `@` side of mentions: finding a person to ping.

  Separate from the `#` fan-out because a ping is always a person, and
  people are core's — there is no module to ask and no permission model to
  federate. What there IS is a decision about who may be pinged at all, and
  the rule shipped here is deliberately narrow:

    * only **active, confirmed** accounts (a pending invite cannot be
      pinged into existence, and a deactivated account is not a colleague);
    * only accounts that can reach the admin area at all, since every
      surface a mention currently appears on lives there — pinging a
      customer about an internal note would be the leak, not the feature.

  Matching is on username, then name, then email — email last and only on a
  prefix, so the typeahead cannot be used to confirm whether an address has
  an account by pasting it in.

  People matching `query`, shaped for the typeahead.

  An empty query returns a short list of candidates rather than nothing:
  opening the picker with `@` and seeing who is around beats a blank box.

  The admin-area rule is evaluated in SQL (Owner/Admin role, or any
  `phoenix_kit_role_permissions` grant), not per-row after fetch. The earlier
  over-fetch + `Scope.for_user/1` filter issued two queries per candidate —
  up to ~128 round trips per keystroke on a full page of results.
