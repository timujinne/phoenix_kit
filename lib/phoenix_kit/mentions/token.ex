defmodule PhoenixKit.Mentions.Token do
  @moduledoc """
  The stored form of a mention, and the only thing that turns free text into
  a link.

  Two shapes, both closed and both carrying their own label:

      @[user:018e3c4a-9f6b-7890-abcd-ef1234567890|Alice Smith]
      #[project:018e3c4a-9f6b-7890-abcd-ef1234567890|Q3 Launch]

  ## Why the label lives in the text

  The token is self-contained on purpose. Text gets copied between records,
  exported, kept in edit history, and read by people with JavaScript off —
  and a module can be uninstalled entirely. A bare foreign key survives none
  of that; this survives all of it, degrading to something a human can still
  read. It also keeps full-text search working: searching "Alice" finds the
  comment, because "Alice" is literally in the column.

  The label is a SNAPSHOT of what the author saw when they picked. It is not
  the display title — `PhoenixKit.Mentions` re-resolves that per viewer at
  render, and deliberately never shows a refreshed title to someone who
  cannot open the record.

  ## What is NOT a mention

  A bare `@alice` or `#launch` is ordinary prose and is never linked. Only
  the closed form above counts, which is what makes escaping mostly a
  non-problem: a token needs the trigger, a known type, a syntactically valid
  UUID, a `|`, a label and a `]`, so typing one by accident is not a thing
  that happens.

  Two deliberate consequences:

    * Publishing's `#hashtag` feature is untouched — the trigger character is
      shared, the stored form is not.
    * An unfinished token (someone typing, or a truncated paste) stays plain
      text rather than becoming a broken link.

  For the rare case of writing a complete-looking token that should NOT
  link, prefix it with a backslash: `\\@[user:…|Alice]`. `render/2` strips the
  backslash and leaves the rest as text.
