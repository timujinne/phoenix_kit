  PhoenixKit PostgreSQL Migration System

  This module handles versioned migrations for PhoenixKit, supporting incremental
  updates and rollbacks between different schema versions.

  ## Migration Versions

  ### V173 - Catalogue attribute groups ⚡ LATEST

  Reusable, translatable attribute groups for the `phoenix_kit_catalogue`
  module: a group ("Idea doors") owns attributes ("Color", "Trim"), each
  attribute owns ordered values ("White", "Oak") with an explicit default,
  and items link to a group through an assignment table (one group per
  item enforced by a droppable unique index, so multi-group later is not
  a data migration). Groups referenced by items can only be archived, not
  deleted (RESTRICT FKs throughout; the module deletes unreferenced draft
  groups via an explicit transactional cascade). Names and values carry
  the module's per-language JSONB `data` translations with stable slug
  keys as durable identity.

  ### V172 - SEO module renamed to Crawlers

  The built-in SEO module becomes Crawlers: everything it held was bot
  policy (the noindex directive, crawler guidance, and now per-bot-group
  access controls), while actual SEO work lives in the external
  phoenix_kit_seo package. Settings rows are renamed
  (seo_module_enabled/seo_no_index -> crawlers_*), roles granted seo gain
  crawlers, and the old seo grants stay for the repair manifest.

  ### V171 - Shop slugs unique per (base language, value)

  Product and category slugs are jsonb maps, and the only uniqueness the
  database enforced was an expression index on the alphabetically-first
  key's value — under-enforcing (other languages unconstrained, collisions
  surfacing on "add translation") and over-enforcing (`{"en":"hat"}` vs
  `{"de":"hat"}` collided though they can never shadow each other in a
  URL) at once. Trigger-maintained projection tables
  (`phoenix_kit_shop_{product,category}_slugs`, PK `(lang, value)`) now
  enforce the bucket the resolver actually reads. Existing duplicates are
  suffixed `-2`, `-3` …; two LIVE rows sharing a bucket raise instead —
  which URL survives is the operator's call. The old indexes are dropped;
  `extract_primary_slug` stays, unused.

  ### V170 - Notification collapsing gets indexes and a uniqueness backstop

  Two indexes for the `upsert_inapp/3` collapsing API. A partial UNIQUE index
  on `(recipient_uuid, metadata->>'dedupe_key')` over undismissed unseen rows
  serves the dedupe lookup and turns the find-then-insert race (two workers
  both inserting the same key) into a constraint the code retries as a
  collapse; existing duplicate unseen rows are folded — all but the newest per
  key marked dismissed — before the index is created. A second index on
  `(recipient_uuid, seen_at IS NOT NULL, inserted_at DESC, uuid DESC)` over
  undismissed rows matches the unseen-first inbox ordering term-for-term, so
  the bell and inbox reads come straight off an index again. Rows without a
  dedupe key are outside both the uniqueness rule and the fold.

  ### V169 - Anonymous entity submissions, and one duplicate foreign key

  Makes `phoenix_kit_entity_data.created_by_uuid` nullable: the public entity
  form is deliberately unauthenticated and has no creator to record, so on a
  freshly migrated database every anonymous submission failed with a
  `not_null_violation`. Long-lived installs were already storing NULL there.
  Recorded in V164's `@relaxed_after_v57` and in the V135 baseline so repair and
  a fresh install agree with it.

  Also drops the duplicate foreign key V135 created on
  `phoenix_kit_ai_requests.prompt_uuid`, keeping the legacy
  `phoenix_kit_ai_requests_prompt_uuid_fkey` — the name the installed base
  carries and the one Ecto derives by default — so no live database needs a
  rename.

  ### V168 - The remaining slug indexes

  Finishes what V167 started. An audit of every schema declaring a slug
  `unique_constraint/3` found two more with nothing to translate:
  `phoenix_kit_tickets` (plain btree since V135, while `Ticket` declares
  `unique_constraint(:slug)` and `get_ticket_by_slug/2` fetches with
  `one()`) and `phoenix_kit_post_groups` (no slug index at all, while
  `PostGroup` names a composite `[:user_uuid, :slug]` index that exists
  nowhere). The other six were already backed correctly.

  Post-group slugs are unique **per user**, so that index is on
  `(user_uuid, slug)` and the dedup partitions by the pair. Existing
  duplicates are suffixed `-2`, `-3` … following `Slug.ensure_unique/2`,
  the oldest row keeping the bare slug.

  ### V167 - Unique post slugs

  Makes `phoenix_kit_posts_slug_index` unique. It had been a plain btree
  since V135 while its sibling `phoenix_kit_post_tags.slug` was unique, so
  `Post`'s `unique_constraint(:slug)` had no index to translate and
  `get_post_by_slug/2` — which fetches with `one()` — raised
  `Ecto.MultipleResultsError` on any URL two posts shared.

  Existing duplicates are suffixed `-2`, `-3` … following
  `Slug.ensure_unique/2`, keeping the reachable post over a draft and then
  the oldest. Two *live* posts on one slug raises instead: one of them has
  to lose a working URL, and that is the operator's call.

  ### V166 - Frozen comment attribution

  Adds `author_display_name`, `attribution_mode`, `attributed_project_uuid`
  and `attributed_label` to `phoenix_kit_comments`. A name resolved at
  render time rewrites history — someone leaves or fills in a profile and
  every comment they wrote is silently re-signed — so what the reader was
  shown is pinned at write. The same applies to speaking on a project's
  behalf, which is a choice made at the time and not a fact recomputed from
  current membership. `user_uuid` is never cleared: posting as the project
  changes what the PUBLIC sees and nothing else, so moderation and audit
  keep their actor.

  Existing rows are left NULL rather than backfilled — inventing a display
  history we do not have would be worse than resolving those rows live.

  ### V165 - Cross-module mentions and access requests

  Adds `phoenix_kit_mentions` (the reverse index for `@`/`#` tokens — the
  canonical mention lives in the text, this answers "what links here" and
  gives notification fan-out something to diff) and
  `phoenix_kit_access_requests` (asking the owner for access to a record a
  mention pointed at but the reader cannot open). Neither target carries a
  foreign key: both point into ~28 optional packages' tables.

  ### V164 - Repair the V56/V57 flush-order bug's fallout, and converge two
  ### prefix-unsafe historical shapes
  - Also folds in what an earlier draft carried as a separate V164: V68
    (partial `idx_publishing_posts_group_slug`) and V65 (the
    `phoenix_kit_subscription_plans_slug_uidx` -> `..._types_slug_uidx`
    rename) each issued a BARE, unqualified DROP/ALTER guarded by `IF
    EXISTS`: effective on `public`, a silent no-op in a named schema, so
    the two install paths diverged and the `V135` baseline — generated
    into a named schema — kept the unintended shape. This version
    idempotently converges both onto the historical `public`/intended
    shape, and is a no-op on every real public install. This release
    ships ONE migration, so it lives here rather than in a second version
  - V56/V57 queued `UUIDFKColumns.up/1`'s `ADD COLUMN`s immediately before
    `add_constraints/1`'s immediate `column_exists?`/NOT NULL guards with
    no `flush()` between them (V57 had none at all) — harmless on an
    incremental chain run, but on a single-shot run (fresh install) the
    guards ran before Postgres had ever seen the queued columns, so ~46
    `*_uuid` FK columns across ~33 tables were left nullable instead of
    NOT NULL, and `phoenix_kit_comments.fk_comments_user_uuid` was never
    created at all — V72 later found it missing and guessed `ON DELETE
    CASCADE` instead of V56/V57's own declared `SET NULL`
  - V56/V57 now carry the missing `flush()`, and V72's guess is now `SET
    NULL`, so this only repairs installs whose single-shot run already
    happened before those fixes; it is a no-op everywhere else
  - Per affected column: sets NOT NULL only if it currently has zero NULL
    rows; otherwise warns (table/column/row count) and leaves it
    nullable — never backfills live data with an invented value
  - Corrects `fk_comments_user_uuid` from CASCADE to SET NULL if the
    buggy shape is present
  - Repair-only: `down/1` restamps the comment, never undoes the fix

  ### V163 - UUID primary-key integrity (catalog-driven repair, upstream #688)
  - Repairs any `phoenix_kit_*` table whose `uuid` column is the wrong
    type, nullable, or not the primary key — the state V40/V56/V74 each
    assumed impossible and a production install reached anyway
    (`phoenix_kit_email_events`: `varchar(255)`, nullable, no PK at all)
  - Catalog-driven on purpose: every earlier attempt enumerated tables by
    hand and this one was missing from every list
  - Above two million rows the `ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE uuid` rewrite and the
    `ADD PRIMARY KEY` are DEFERRED and logged with the command to run in a
    maintenance window, rather than taking `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` on a large
    table mid-deploy; `mix phoenix_kit.doctor` is the loud channel
  - Runs BEFORE V164 by construction, which is the order V164 needs: a
    foreign key cannot reference a column with no unique/primary key, so
    promoting `uuid` to PK here is what lets V164's FK repair validate
  - NOTE: upstream's own moduledoc for this version is missing — its
    heading landed above V162's body and V162's heading was lost. The
    section below is written from `v163.ex`'s own moduledoc; carry this
    correction back in the PR

  ### V162 - Payment-option linkage on billing orders

  Adds a nullable `payment_option_uuid` FK (+ index) to
  `phoenix_kit_orders`, pointing at `phoenix_kit_payment_options`. The
  order's `payment_method` is a small closed vocabulary; the payment
  OPTION is the operator-configured row the customer actually chose, and
  the choice used to be discarded at checkout. `ON DELETE SET NULL` so
  deleting an option neither fails nor destroys order history.

  ### V161 - Case-insensitive `phoenix_kit_users.username` (citext)
  - `username` was `VARCHAR(255)` (V08's `:string`) — comparison semantics
    come from the column type, not the Ecto schema field, so every lookup
    (`get_user_by_username/1`, `unsafe_validate_unique`, the unique index
    itself) was exact-match; `alice` and `Alice` could both register
  - Converts the column to `citext`, same fix already applied to `email`
    in V01 and the CRM party email columns in V151
  - Pre-check (mirrors V106's down-step) raises on any existing
    case-insensitive collision before the DDL runs, naming the offending
    value; `WHERE username IS NOT NULL` guards against nullable rows
    false-colliding under `GROUP BY`
  - `varchar` → `citext` is binary-coercible (`pg_cast.castmethod = 'b'`),
    confirmed live — no table rewrite; the column's B-tree index does get
    rebuilt (also confirmed live), which is what makes it enforce
    case-insensitive uniqueness right after the `ALTER`

  ### V160 - Settings `value` widened to TEXT
  - `phoenix_kit_settings.value` was `VARCHAR(255)` (V03's `:string`) while
    `Settings.Setting` validated it at `max: 1000` — anything in between
    passed the changeset and then raised a raw `Postgrex.Error`
  - Surfaced by list-valued settings: the sitemap's default exclude
    patterns serialize to ~450 characters, so saving them always crashed
  - Catalog-only change in PostgreSQL: no rewrite, no long lock

  ### V159 - Publishing categories + post view counters
  - `phoenix_kit_publishing_categories` — hierarchical per-group taxonomy
    (nullable `parent_uuid` self-FK, V103 catalogue shape); `slug` unique
    per group; `name_i18n` JSONB per-language display names; `position`
    for manual ordering; group delete cascades, parent delete lifts
    children to the root (`ON DELETE SET NULL`)
  - `phoenix_kit_publishing_post_categories` — post↔category M:N
    (post-level, WordPress semantics — not per-version); both sides
    cascade
  - `phoenix_kit_publishing_post_views` — per-day view rollups keyed
    `(post_uuid, view_date)`, incremented in place; totals are
    `SUM(count)`; dedup/bot filtering are app-side, no reader PII stored

  ### V158 - Broadcast attachments (accumulator)
  - Adds `attachments JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'` to
    `phoenix_kit_newsletters_broadcasts` — an ordered list of Storage
    file uuids attached to every email of the broadcast; soft references
    (no FK) per this table's `crm_list_uuid` precedent, with a
    `jsonb_typeof = 'array'` CHECK as the DB-level shape backstop
  - Shipped in 1.7.211 — the accumulator is closed; the next restructuring
    section opens V159

  ### V157 - Image annotation kind
  - Widens `phoenix_kit_annotations_kind_check` to allow `'image'`
  - Pairs with the schema's `@kinds` (also widened) so Etcher's `:image`
    tool — exposed in the media viewer's toolbar by PR #660 — can
    actually persist; same regression shape as V130's `"marker"`

  ### V156 - Legacy newsletters lists migrated into CRM, tables dropped
  - **Requires a coordinated release with the newsletters module** — drops
    tables/columns an older newsletters release still reads; see V156's
    moduledoc warning
  - Data: every `phoenix_kit_newsletters_lists` row copied to
    `phoenix_kit_crm_lists` (same slug — reused if a CRM list already has
    it), `subscribable = true`
  - Data: a `phoenix_kit_crm_contacts` row per distinct user with a legacy
    membership (reused if one already exists by email), linked to that
    user's `user_uuid` via a straight UPDATE against `phoenix_kit_users` —
    never creates a user, `connect_user/2`'s placeholder-minting is
    structurally unreachable from this migration
  - Data: legacy memberships copied to `phoenix_kit_crm_list_members`,
    status mapped (`active`→`subscribed`, `unsubscribed`→`removed`),
    `subscribed_at`/`unsubscribed_at` preserved verbatim (not `now()`);
    `subscriber_count` recounted after
  - Re-points every `newsletters_list` broadcast still referencing a
    migrated list to `source_type = 'crm_list'` + `crm_list_uuid`; any
    broadcast an orphaned `list_uuid` couldn't be re-pointed from (should
    be none — `ON DELETE RESTRICT` guarantees referential integrity, see
    moduledoc) has that uuid preserved into
    `source_params->>'legacy_list_uuid'` first
  - Drops `fk_newsletters_broadcasts_list` + `list_uuid` column, then
    `phoenix_kit_newsletters_list_members` and `phoenix_kit_newsletters_lists`
    themselves
  - `down/1` restores the two tables (V79 shape) and the FK/column
    (nullable, matching V152) — structure only, migrated/re-pointed data
    is not moved back

  ### V155 - Delivery CRM contact id + per-broadcast dedup
  - Adds `crm_contact_uuid` (bare, nullable UUID, no FK — same soft-ref
    pattern as `crm_list_uuid`) to `phoenix_kit_newsletters_deliveries`,
    plus a plain index on it
  - Replaces `phoenix_kit_newsletters_deliveries_recipient_check` (same
    name) with a widened CHECK: still requires an addressable recipient
    (`user_uuid` or `recipient_email`), and now additionally forbids a
    row claimed by both `user_uuid` and `crm_contact_uuid` at once —
    deliberately NOT a strict XOR; see V155's moduledoc for why
  - Adds three partial unique indexes — `(broadcast_uuid, user_uuid)`,
    `(broadcast_uuid, crm_contact_uuid)`, `(broadcast_uuid,
    recipient_email)`, each `WHERE ... IS NOT NULL` — the first DB-level
    per-broadcast delivery dedup; `insert_all` previously had no
    `ON CONFLICT` guard at all
  - Adds `source_params JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` to
    `phoenix_kit_newsletters_broadcasts`, for the new `user_group`
    (core-role) recipient source — a role set, so JSONB rather than
    another scalar soft-ref uuid column. Shape:
    `%{"role_uuids" => [...], "role_names_snapshot" => [...]}` — uuids
    resolve (a role's name is mutable), the name snapshot is display-only

  ### V154 - OpenGraph templates + assignments (`phoenix_kit_og`)
  - Adds `phoenix_kit_og_templates` (reusable OG canvas designs; JSONB
    `canvas` element list) and `phoenix_kit_og_assignments` (binds a
    template to a `module_key × scope_type × scope_uuid` scope with a JSONB
    `slot_mapping`). Uniqueness via a partial-index pair (NULL `scope_uuid`
    is the module-wide default tier); `template_uuid` cascades on delete.
    Powers the `phoenix_kit_og` plugin.

  ### V153 - Folder header size defaults to small
  - Flips `phoenix_kit_media_folders.header_size` column default from
    'medium' (V134) to 'small', and backfills existing 'medium' rows to
    'small' ('medium' was the old default, so it reads as untouched;
    'large' is a deliberate choice and is left alone)

  ### V152 - Newsletters/CRM/Core restructuring (accumulator)
  - Unreleased — per the "one open migration" rule, every DDL step of the
    restructuring plan lands in V152 as its own section until it ships;
    later stages append here rather than opening V153.
  - Section: send profiles move to core Email. Creates
    `phoenix_kit_email_send_profiles` — same shape V145 gave
    `phoenix_kit_newsletters_send_profiles`, now owned by core's
    `PhoenixKit.Email` namespace. Copies every row across by `uuid`, then
    drops the V145 table. `idx_nl_send_profiles_*` indexes become
    `idx_email_send_profiles_*`. Does not touch
    `phoenix_kit_newsletters_broadcasts.send_profile_uuid` — still a bare
    UUID with no FK, so it points at the same row regardless of which
    table now owns it.

  ### V150 - Readable device name on session tokens
  - Adds nullable `browser` + `os` to `phoenix_kit_users_tokens`, parsed
    from the User-Agent at login, so the Active Sessions list and admin
    all-sessions view show a device name for every session without the
    known-devices/geo machinery (which stays gated behind new-login alerts).

  ### V149 - Catalogue item-supplier sourcing info + CRM xref
  - Adds `phoenix_kit_cat_item_supplier_info` (per-item, per-supplier SKU /
    unit cost / currency / lead time / MOQ; `supplier_uuid` soft ref to a
    CRM party or local `cat_supplier`) and a soft `crm_company_uuid` xref on
    `phoenix_kit_cat_suppliers`. No primary among these rows — the item's
    default supplier is the V146 `primary_supplier_uuid` scalar.

  ### V148 - CRM party roles (suppliers, clients)
  - Adds `phoenix_kit_crm_party_roles` for the `phoenix_kit_crm` module:
    polymorphic role edge marking a CRM company or contact as `supplier`,
    `client`, or other commercial role. One party can hold several roles;
    `valid_from`/`valid_to` lifecycle, `is_active` filter, role-scoped
    `metadata`. No FK on `roleable_uuid`; unique on
    `(roleable_type, roleable_uuid, role)`.

  ### V147 - Known-device geo-location
  - Adds nullable `location` (`City, Country`) to
    `phoenix_kit_user_known_devices`. Resolved once at new-device time by
    `PhoenixKit.Users.LoginAlerts` and stored so the user's Active Sessions
    list can show sign-in location without a per-render geo lookup.

  ### V146 - Catalogue item primary supplier
  - Adds nullable `primary_supplier_uuid` FK (`ON DELETE SET NULL`) +
    partial index to `phoenix_kit_cat_items` — an item's default
    supplier, independent of manufacturer (generic/unbranded materials;
    tie-break when a manufacturer has several suppliers). Backs the
    `phoenix_kit_catalogue` feature from its commit 2e47cdf.

  ### V145 - Newsletters Send Settings (send profiles)
  - Adds `phoenix_kit_newsletters_send_profiles`: named send configurations
    referencing a core Integrations connection (`integration_uuid`, no FK)
    plus per-account send parameters (from-name/email, reply-to, signature,
    rate limits, `advanced` per-provider extras jsonb).
  - Multiple profiles may share one integration; at most one may be
    `is_default`, enforced by a partial unique index on `is_default`.
  - Adds `send_profile_uuid` (bare UUID, no FK) to
    `phoenix_kit_newsletters_broadcasts` so a broadcast can pin which send
    profile delivers it.

  ### V144 - Manufacturing/Warehouse module tables consolidation
  - Consolidates 5 objects previously created by `phoenix_kit_manufacturing`'s
    and `phoenix_kit_warehouse`'s own `migration_module/0` into core's
    migration chain: `phoenix_kit_machines`, `phoenix_kit_machine_type_assignments`,
    `phoenix_kit_machine_operations`, `phoenix_kit_warehouse_transfers`
    (+ its `number` sequence), and `phoenix_kit_warehouse_min_stock`.
  - `machine_type_uuid`/`operation_uuid` on the two join tables are soft
    references (no FK) to the entities package. Upgrade path for hosts on
    the published `phoenix_kit_manufacturing` 0.2.0 (module V1): the join
    table already exists there with a *live* FK on `machine_type_uuid` —
    this migration drops it unconditionally. Warehouse tables are
    fresh-install-only DDL (`phoenix_kit_warehouse` 0.1.0 never published
    migrations for them, so no upgrade case exists).
  - The pre-V5 manufacturing directory tables (`phoenix_kit_machine_types`,
    `phoenix_kit_operations`, `phoenix_kit_defect_reasons`) are not
    re-created; each is dropped only if present and empty, left in place
    with a database `NOTICE` when non-empty — see the PR body for the
    manual data-migration note on such hosts.
  - Rollback mirrors the five creates; see `V144.down/1`'s moduledoc for
    the upgrade-host caveat (can't distinguish a pre-existing
    `machine_type_assignments` table from one V144 created).

  ### V143 - Known-device history for new-login alerts
  - Adds `phoenix_kit_user_known_devices` (IP + hashed user-agent per user,
    unique per `(user_uuid, ip_address, user_agent_hash)`) so a login from
    an unrecognized device can be told apart from a familiar one.
  - Backs the `new_login_alert_enabled` setting and
    `user.new_login_detected` activity action.

  ### V142 - Wider role-permission keys
  - Widens `phoenix_kit_role_permissions.module_key` from `VARCHAR(50)` to
    `VARCHAR(120)` so fine-grained sub-permissions can be stored as composed
    dotted keys (`"calendar.view_others"` — base and sub parts are each
    capped at 50 chars, so a composed key can reach 101).
  - Rollback deletes rows over 50 chars (sub-permission grants are additive
    and re-grantable) before narrowing the column back.

  ### V141 - Calendar events + participants
  - Adds `phoenix_kit_calendar_events` for the `phoenix_kit_calendar` module:
    one implicit personal calendar per user (`owner_uuid` FK, CASCADE on user
    delete). Timed events use an exclusive-end UTC pair; all-day events use an
    exclusive-end DATE pair; a CHECK enforces exactly one pair per row matching
    the `all_day` flag, with end > start. Status is active/cancelled.
    `location_uuid` loosely links a stored location (name snapshotted into the
    `location` string — no cross-module FK).
  - Adds `phoenix_kit_calendar_event_participants`: loose `kind` + `target_uuid`
    references (user / staff_person / crm_contact / crm_company / free_text)
    with a `display_name` snapshot and `added_by_uuid` audit. Visibility is
    resolved LIVE at query time against the physical staff/CRM tables, so a
    company participant means "current members" and no module code is needed.
    Partial uniques dedup targets per event and free-text case-insensitively.
  - Extended in place while unreleased (idempotent-additive statements).
  - Rollback drops both tables.

  ### V140 - Warehouse module tables
  - Creates `phoenix_kit_warehouse_stock`, `phoenix_kit_warehouse_inventory_documents`,
    `phoenix_kit_warehouse_internal_orders`, `phoenix_kit_warehouse_supplier_orders`,
    `phoenix_kit_warehouse_goods_receipts`, and `phoenix_kit_warehouse_goods_issues` —
    the storage layer for the standalone `phoenix_kit_warehouse` package.
  - `internal_orders` and `goods_issues` have no FK to any order table — the
    relationship lives in a generic `source_refs` JSONB column instead, resolved
    by a host-registered callback so the package has zero dependency on any
    particular "order" concept. GIN-indexed for reverse lookups.
  - Intra-module FKs preserved: `supplier_orders.internal_order_uuid` →
    `internal_orders`; `goods_receipts.supplier_order_uuid` → `supplier_orders`;
    `goods_issues.internal_order_uuid` → `internal_orders`.
  - `item_uuid`, `location_uuid`, `storage_folder_uuid`, `supplier_uuid` are
    plain UUID columns — no FK, so the database does not enforce referential
    integrity for them (delete semantics still undecided).
  - No data is copied from any existing table — these tables are empty until a
    consuming app populates them.

  ### V139 - Dashboard `config` column
  - Adds a JSONB `config` column (`NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'`) to
    `phoenix_kit_dashboards` for per-dashboard presentation settings, read and
    written whole like `layout`. Backs the dashboards plugin module.
  - Idempotent (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`); rollback drops the column.

  ### V138 - CRM v1 interaction tracker
  - Adds five `phoenix_kit_crm_*` tables for the CRM module's first data model:
    `contacts` (profile + **optional** `user_uuid` login link, partial-unique so
    it's 1:1 only among linked rows), `companies`, `company_memberships` (M:N
    contact↔company with free-form `role_in_company` + `department` + `is_primary`
    on the edge), `interactions` (logged interaction: type/when/body/subject
    contact/owner user), and `interaction_parties` (flat resolvable "who was
    involved": `raw_name` always kept, `contact_uuid`/`staff_person_uuid` resolve
    when matched under an exclusive-arc CHECK, `party_snapshot` JSONB freezes the
    party's profile as-of-then). `staff_person_uuid` is a soft ref (no FK) so the
    optional staff module stays optional.

  ### V136 - Staff employment history
  - Adds `phoenix_kit_staff_employments` — a per-person history of employment
    spans (employment type, translatable `job_title`, org placement via
    `primary_department_uuid` + a `primary_team_uuid` snapshot, date range with
    `employment_end_date IS NULL` = the open/current span, `work_location`,
    `notes`). A partial unique index enforces one open span per person. The
    matching `phoenix_kit_staff_people` columns are kept as a denormalized mirror
    of the current span (written by the app's `sync_current/1`), not dropped.
    Backfills one open span per existing person from those columns (guarded,
    retry-safe; people with no employment data are skipped).

  ### V135 - Structured staff skills
  - Replaces the free-text `phoenix_kit_staff_people.skills` column with a
    first-class translatable `phoenix_kit_staff_skills` entity + a
    `phoenix_kit_staff_person_skills` join. Each skill carries its own
    per-skill, translatable proficiency levels (`levels` JSONB array of
    `{id, name, translations}`) and an `allow_multiple_levels` boolean; the
    join's `proficiency_levels` JSONB array holds the selected level ids.
    Migrates the comma-separated free-text into structured rows (case-insensitive
    dedup, guarded for retry-safety) and drops the column. Lossy by design:
    per-locale `translations["skills"]` overrides don't map to structured skills
    and are stripped. Also adds a partial index on
    `phoenix_kit_staff_people(date_of_birth)` (active + non-null DOB only) for
    `Staff.upcoming_birthdays/1`.

  ### V01 - V134 - Baseline (consolidated into V135 by the squash)

  Every version from V01 (initial auth/roles/settings foundation) through
  V134 (media-folder header customization) has been collapsed into the
  `V135` baseline module — this release's `@initial_version` (the squash
  floor; spec `dev_docs/plans/2026-07-14-squash-migrations-spec.md`).
  `V135.up/1` applies the FINAL post-V134 shape of every table, index,
  constraint, function, extension, and seed directly — no intermediate
  drops/renames/backfills are replayed. See
  `dev_docs/plans/2026-07-14-squash-inventory.md` for the full
  per-version history this consolidates (seeds, drops/renames, hazards)
  and `PhoenixKit.Migrations.ExpectedSchema`
  (`lib/phoenix_kit/migrations/expected_schema.ex`, tool-generated,
  `@moduledoc false`) for the machine-readable manifest the baseline was
  generated from.

  Installs below V135 cannot upgrade directly to this release --
  `up/1`/`down/1` raise `PhoenixKit.Migrations.BelowFloorError` — they
  must first apply the frozen pre-squash 1.7.x bridge release up to at
  least V135, then move to this release (spec §7.2's two-stage rollout /
  §5.2's registry guards).

  ## Migration Paths

  ### Fresh Installation (0 -> Current)
  Applies the `V135` baseline (the consolidated V01..V134 shape), then
  every delta V136..V164 in sequence (`plan_up/3`'s fresh-install clamp,
  spec §5.2 D13).

  ### Incremental Updates
  - Below V135: rejected with `PhoenixKit.Migrations.BelowFloorError` --
    apply the 1.7.x bridge release first (spec §7.2).
  - At V135 (the floor) or above: runs each delta module from
    `current + 1` through the target version in sequence.

  ### Rollback Support
  - Down to any version above V135: runs each delta module's `down/1` in
    reverse, from `current` down to `target + 1`.
  - Down to V135 or below: the delta range stops at V136 (never
    dispatches a deleted below-floor module); `V135.down/1` is then
    applied directly for a full `version: 0` teardown (Oban included). A
    target strictly between 0 and V135 clamps to V135 instead of
    guessing an unreproducible intermediate shape (spec §5.2's
    `{:clamped, ...}`).

  ## Usage Examples

      # Update to the latest version
      PhoenixKit.Migrations.Postgres.up(prefix: "myapp")

      # Update to a specific version
      PhoenixKit.Migrations.Postgres.up(prefix: "myapp", version: 150)

      # Rollback to a specific version
      PhoenixKit.Migrations.Postgres.down(prefix: "myapp", version: 149)

      # Complete rollback (tears down the V135 baseline too)
      PhoenixKit.Migrations.Postgres.down(prefix: "myapp", version: 0)

  ## PostgreSQL Features
  - Schema prefix support for multi-tenant applications
  - Optimized indexes for performance
  - Foreign key constraints with proper cascading
  - Extension support (citext)
  - Version tracking with table comments

  # Same key `PhoenixKit.Migrations.Repair` locks on (spec §6.1). Read what it
  # does and does not buy before relying on it:
  #
  #   * A chain run that starts while a repair already holds the lock WAITS
  #     here until that repair finishes (bounded, see below). That direction is
  #     real exclusion, on the install path and the update path alike — the
  #     acquire itself contends even when the lock cannot then be HELD.
  #     Deliberately taken before the version read, so it also covers a run
  #     that turns out to be a no-op: one statement, and if a repair really is
  #     running, waiting for it is the correct answer rather than reading a
  #     comment it is in the middle of changing.
  #   * A repair that starts while a chain run is mid-DDL is NOT blocked. The
  #     wrappers this chain runs under are generated with
  #     `@disable_ddl_transaction true` (`mix phoenix_kit.update`,
  #     `phoenix_kit.gen.migration`), so there is no enclosing transaction and
  #     this statement auto-commits — the lock is released before the DDL that
  #     follows it. Repair's before/after version-comment re-read
  #     (`Repair.CommentPolicy.concurrent_migration?/2`, S18) is what catches
  #     that direction, by detection rather than prevention.
  #
  # Transaction-scoped anyway, and deliberately not repair's session-scoped
  # form: a session lock taken here would survive a raising migration and ride
  # the connection back into the pool, where nothing ever unlocks it and every
  # later repair on that key blocks forever. Releasing it by hand is not
  # sufficient either — `execute/1` only QUEUES DDL, so an unlock at the end of
  # `up/1` would fire before the queued statements are flushed. Making the
  # remaining direction real needs a design change, not a bigger lock.
  # `pg_try_...` in a bounded loop, never the blocking `pg_advisory_xact_lock`:
  # `Ecto.Migrator` runs migrations with `timeout: :infinity`, so the blocking
  # form turns a held lock into a silent, unbounded hang with nothing printed
  # (Opus review 2026-08-07). Waiting is still the right behaviour — a repair
  # mid-flight is exactly what this lock is for — but it has to be visible and
  # it has to end.
