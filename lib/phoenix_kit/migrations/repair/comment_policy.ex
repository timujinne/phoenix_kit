defmodule PhoenixKit.Migrations.Repair.CommentPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  Pure decision logic for the version-comment policy, spec §6.4 R1-R6. Every
  function here is DB-free — the caller (`PhoenixKit.Migrations.Repair`) does
  the actual reading/writing and passes in already-fetched values.

  ## Why "floor" here is `PhoenixKit.Migrations.Postgres.initial_version/0`, not a fixed number

  §6.4's R3 ("`0 < comment < floor` → hard `BelowFloorError`") is written for
  the **post-squash** world, where `floor` is a real number greater than 1.
  The chain is squashed at floor 135, so `initial_version/0` is `135` and
  `classify/3`'s `:below_floor` branch is LIVE: every install still at
  V01..V134 lands in it. (It was dormant while the floor was 1 — no integer
  satisfies `0 < comment < 1` — which is why the tests drive it with
  synthetic floors like `121` rather than whatever `initial_version/0`
  happens to compile to.)

  ## R1 ("never lower the comment")

  Not a branch here — it is a postcondition every function in this module
  upholds by construction: `classify/3` never proposes writing a comment at
  all (that is `PhoenixKit.Migrations.Repair`'s job, driven by
  `should_heal_comment?/2` and `adopt_outcome/2`), and both of those only ever
  return a version `>=` what triggered them (`{:stale_low, target}` has
  `target > comment` by `marker_cross_check/2`'s own guard; `adopt_outcome/2`
  only fires from the NULL-comment branch, where any stamp is a raise).

  ## R2/R5 as one computation

  R2's "stale-LOW comment" (schema ahead of what the comment claims) and R5's
  "lying-HIGH ... comment ahead of schema" warning are opposite readings of
  the same number: the highest version whose objects are *all* structurally
  present (`highest_fully_present_version/1`, the generalized form of
  `PhoenixKit.Migrations.Postgres.heal_version_comment/2`'s single hardcoded
  `{83, ...}` marker probe — spec's own word for it is "generalized").
  `marker_cross_check/2` compares that number against the comment and reports
  whichever side is warranted (or `:consistent` when they agree).

  `since` bucket the caller actually probed, in any order. Correctness
  depends on the caller having probed **every** `since` value from the
  smallest up to (at least) the answer; a caller that skips a low `since`
  bucket entirely gets a result as if that bucket were fully present, which
  is why `PhoenixKit.Migrations.Repair.Probe`'s caller probes the whole
  manifest, not just "since above the comment".
