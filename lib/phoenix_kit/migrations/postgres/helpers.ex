defmodule PhoenixKit.Migrations.Postgres.Helpers do
  @moduledoc """
  Shared SQL helpers for the versioned Postgres migration chain.

  Centralizes the prefix-sensitive patterns that individual version
  modules used to hand-roll (and get subtly wrong in independent ways):

    * `qualify_table/2` — schema-qualified table reference for raw SQL
      in NEW migration code (existing versions keep their local helpers;
      migrating them is opportunistic). Index **names** must stay bare on
      `CREATE INDEX` (Postgres rejects `CREATE INDEX schema.name`); only
      `DROP INDEX schema.name` accepts a qualified name.
    * `validate_prefix!/1` — rejects prefixes that can't be interpolated
      into SQL safely. Called at the `up/down` entry points and by the
      prefix-resolving tooling (`PrefixConfig.resolve_prefix/1`,
      `Install.Common`).
    * `ensure_extension!/1` — privilege-aware replacement for a bare
      `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS`. Postgres checks the CREATE
      privilege *before* the IF-NOT-EXISTS short-circuit, so the bare
      statement fails for low-privilege roles even when the extension is
      already installed. This helper checks `pg_extension` first and
      only attempts creation when the extension is genuinely missing.
    * `ensure_uuid_v7_function/1` — creates `uuid_generate_v7()` inside
      the install's schema (never wherever `search_path` happens to
      point, which pollutes `public` and fails outright on PG15+ where
      `public` isn't world-writable). Unlike `ensure_extension!/1`, this
      one does NOT pre-check existence — it queues `CREATE OR REPLACE
      FUNCTION` for every install whose role owns (or could own) the
      function. That is deliberate, not a missed optimization: an
      `unless already exists` guard here (the original
      shape) meant a function created before some later fix to this same
      body (e.g. the pgcrypto schema-qualification change) stayed on the
      OLD body forever — `CREATE OR REPLACE` never got a chance to run
      because the guard always saw "exists" and skipped it, and there was
      no other path back to a correct body short of a manual `DROP`.
      `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` on an unchanged signature is additive
      and idempotent (no dependent objects break, nothing is dropped), so
      the guard bought nothing but a stuck body — removing it is what lets
      `PhoenixKit.Migrations.Repair` self-heal a drifted body via this
      same helper instead of reporting a permanent, un-fixable finding.
      The one case still checked first is an existing function owned by
      *another* role: `CREATE OR REPLACE` requires ownership, and in
      migration context the statement is only QUEUED, so that failure
      arrives at flush time where no `rescue` here can reach it and the
      migration aborts. That topology is documented and supported
      (`PhoenixKit.Migration`'s moduledoc tells a DBA to pre-create the
      function), so it is excluded before the statement is queued.

  Functions without a `repo` argument run in `Ecto.Migration` context
  (immediate existence checks via `repo().query/3`, DDL queued via
  `execute/1`). The `repo`-taking variants are for runtime callers outside
  a migration context, e.g. `mix phoenix_kit.repair`.

  # The V26/V56 conventions embed the schema PREFIX directly into a handful

  # schema-qualifying a table reference. Postgres silently TRUNCATES any
