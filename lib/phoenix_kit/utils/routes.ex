  Returns `true` when `path` is safe to use as a local redirect / `return_to`
  target: a binary that begins with a single `/` but not `//` or `/\\` — both of
  which browsers resolve as protocol-relative, host-switching URLs. Use this to
  guard user-supplied redirect params against open-redirect attacks.

  ASCII control characters are rejected too. Browsers strip tab/CR/LF while
  parsing a URL, so `"/\\t/evil.example"` (from `?return_to=%2F%09%2Fevil.example`)
  becomes `//evil.example` — a cross-origin navigation — once it reaches
  `window.location`. `Phoenix.Controller.redirect/2` blocks those itself, but
  LiveView's `validate_local_url!` only rejects `\\\\` and a leading `//`, so a

  Resolves where to send a user once they are signed in and confirmed.

  Takes candidate destinations in priority order (e.g. a `?return_to=` param,
  then the session's `user_return_to`) and returns the first that passes
  `local_path?/1`. Falls back to the `after_login_path` setting, then to
  core's own guaranteed landing, `/admin`.

  The setting is validated as a local path when saved, but is re-guarded here
  so a hand-edited DB row can't turn a post-auth redirect into an open
  redirect. Single source of truth for the post-auth landing page — used by
  the login flow (`signed_in_path/1`) and by both confirmation LiveViews.

  ## Options

    * `:context` — the `conn`/`socket` the redirect is being built for. **Pass
      it wherever one is at hand.** `"/"` is the host's home page and core
      declares no route for it; with a context the tail of the chain is probed
      with `routable?/2` and, when the host really has no `/`, handed to
      `safe_destination/2`, which can then pick the *best* destination for this
      subject instead of merely a safe one. Without a context the tail is
      `path("/admin")` — still safe, just less specific.
    * `:scope` — the subject, forwarded to `safe_destination/2` for that last
      step. Only consulted when a `:context` is present.

  The context-less tail is `path("/admin")` and deliberately **not**
  `safe_destination(nil, opts)`: with no scope to go on that call runs the
  ANONYMOUS chain and terminates on `/users/log-in`, whose `on_mount` bounces
  an authenticated visitor straight back through here — the "core-owned
  destination" guarantee would survive exactly one hop. `/admin` is scope-blind
  on purpose: core declares it unconditionally and admits every authenticated
  visitor, so it cannot bounce anyone.

  Resolves where to send a visitor that core is *allowed* to send them.

  Replaces every hardcoded `"/"` / `Routes.path("/")` destination in core.
  `Routes.path("/")` emits a locale-prefixed root (`/en`); the route that would
  serve it belongs to the host application, which core cannot declare, so on a
  host that never declared one every such redirect 404s.

  ## The chain

  Authenticated (`opts[:scope]` passes `Scope.authenticated?/1`):

    1. `:return_to` — the untrusted explicit destination
    2. `/admin`, when `Scope.can_access_admin_area?/1` and `:skip_admin` is not set
    3. `/dashboard`
    4. the `after_login_path` setting
    5. the host's home page — `path("/")`, then `"/"`

  Anonymous:

    1. the `main_page_path` setting, when set and still resolvable
    2. the host's home page — `path("/")`, then `"/"`

  Every candidate must be a local path (`local_path?/1`), not an auth page
  (`auth_page?/1`), **and actually routable** (`routable?/2`). Under
  `:skip_admin` it must additionally not be an admin-area path
  (`admin_area_path?/1`) — see the option below.

  The home page is a candidate like any other, and only like any other. It is
  the one destination in this whole mechanism that core cannot declare, so it
  is used exactly where the host proves it declared it, and skipped silently
  everywhere else. Dropping it entirely would have been a silent regression for
  every already-working install, where logging out has always landed on the
  site home.

  Both shapes are offered, locale-prefixed first, because a multilingual host
  may declare either or both — see `home_candidates/0`. The prefixed form is
  what the eleven original call sites emitted; the defect was that they emitted
  it *unprobed*, not that they named it.

  When nothing survives, the terminal is core's own: `/admin` for any
  authenticated visitor, `/users/log-in` for an anonymous one. The terminal
  follows authentication rather than being a single page, because
  `/users/log-in` bounces a signed-in visitor straight back out again —
  terminating an authenticated chain there would hand the decision to
  `post_auth_path/2`, one hop later.

  ## Options

    * `:scope` — `%PhoenixKit.Users.Auth.Scope{}` or `nil`. **Pass it
      explicitly.** Several call sites run on pipelines that never assign a
      scope, and full logout still carries the just-logged-out user in
      `conn.assigns` after the session has been cleared, so inferring it here
      would answer "authenticated" about someone who no longer is.
    * `:return_to` — a candidate path, or a list of them in priority order.
      Honoured on the authenticated chain only: an anonymous pending
      destination belongs in the `user_return_to` session key, not in a
      redirect.
    * `:skip_admin` — the caller is *rejecting* this visitor from the admin
      area. It suppresses step 2 **and drops every remaining candidate that
      resolves into the admin area** (`admin_area_path?/1`), whichever step
      produced it — a `:return_to`, or an `after_login_path` an operator
      pointed at `/admin/users`. Suppressing only step 2 was not enough: on a
      host with `user_dashboard_enabled: false` the setting was the first
      candidate left standing, it is routable, and handing it back re-entered
      the same gate that had just refused the visitor — a candidate always won,
      the terminal was never reached, and the browser gave up with
      `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`.

      The terminal is deliberately NOT filtered: it is the `/admin` index,
      which the gate admits every authenticated visitor to, so arriving there
      is a render rather than a second bounce. That asymmetry is the whole
      point — the chain has somewhere to end.

  ## The invariant

  Every value returned is either a path the caller supplied, an administrator
  configured, or one of the two shapes of the host's own home page — **each
  proven to resolve in the router** — or one of the two landings core declares
  itself. There is no third branch, and nothing is ever returned unprobed
  except those two landings, which core declares and permits unconditionally.

  `path("/")`, the locale-prefixed root that started all this, is therefore
  still a candidate — it simply may no longer be *synthesized*. That distinction
  is the fix: the eleven original call sites returned it without asking whether
  it resolved, which is why it 404'd.

  The invariant used to be "every candidate was probed, terminals included",
  because core could promise nothing about its own pages: `/dashboard` is
  compiled out by `user_dashboard_enabled: false`, and `/admin` used to reject
  an authenticated visitor who held no admin rights. Neither is true of the
  terminals any more:

    * `/admin` is declared unconditionally by the admin index route and, since
      `:phoenix_kit_ensure_admin` exempts that one view from its permission
      checks (`PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth.landing_view?/1`), admits every
      authenticated visitor — one who holds no rights is greeted and shown
      nothing else. So it can neither 404 nor bounce.
    * `/users/log-in` is declared unconditionally too, by the public auth
      surface. That is a **separate** fact from the `/admin` decision: it rests
      on `generate_public_live_routes/1` in `PhoenixKitWeb.Integration`, not on
      anything the admin area does, and it holds independently of it.

  So the invariant is now: **the chain ends at a path core declares
  unconditionally and permits unconditionally.** The terminal is still handed
  to `routable?/2`, but only as a diagnostic — the arm is returned either way,
  and the probe exists to name a misconfigured install in the log instead of
  letting it surface as a mystery 404. See `terminal/2`.

  That invariant is about the TERMINAL, and stating it was not enough to make
  the chain terminate. A candidate that wins is returned instead of the
  terminal, so under `:skip_admin` — the rejection path — the candidates are
  held to the weaker fact the caller actually needs: **no candidate may be an
  admin-area path.** Otherwise the resolver can answer with the very kind of
  page the visitor was just refused, the gate refuses it again, and the
  identical computation runs forever without ever reaching the terminal it was
  promised. With the filter in place a `skip_admin` resolution is either a
  non-admin path proven routable in this router, or the `/admin` index — and
  the index admits everyone, so the next hop renders.

  The authenticated terminal is not an auth page: `/users/log-in` redirects an
  authenticated visitor through `post_auth_path/2`, which re-enters this
  function, so using it there is an infinite redirect rather than a fallback.

  #     authenticated visitor may open it; one holding no rights is greeted and
  #     shown nothing else.
  #
  #     This is why there is no longer an `admin?` gate here. The previous
  #     version gated every /admin arm on it, and had to: an unconditional
  #     /admin arm looped, because the admin guard bounced a non-admin back
  #     through `safe_destination/2` with `skip_admin: true` and got the same
  #     arm again. /admin no longer rejects an authenticated visitor, so THIS
  #     ARM has nothing left to bounce off and nothing left to loop.
  #
  #     That is a statement about the terminal and nothing else — it was once
  #     written as though it settled the whole function, and it did not. A

  #     admin-area candidate reproduced the very loop this arm had been cleared
  #     of: the guard bounced the visitor back with `skip_admin: true`, the
  #     candidate won again, and the terminal was never reached. Candidates
  #     carry their own rule, in `admissible_candidate?/3`: under `skip_admin`
  #     none of them may be an admin path. Only then is the terminal the one

  Builds a PhoenixKit path: the host's mount prefix, plus a locale segment when
  the site is multilingual.

  ## The `:locale` option

  This is the contract, and it is what a bilingual site needs when auth pages
  come out in the wrong language. Without it the locale is *determined* — from
  the process's Gettext locale — which is right for a link rendered inside a
  request and wrong for a link built outside one (an email, a background job, a
  script).

  - `locale: "et"` — force this locale.
  - `locale: :none` — emit no locale segment at all. For anything that is not a
    page: assets, webhooks, `sitemap.xml`.
  - `locale: nil` or omitted — determine it from the current process.

  ### Examples

      Routes.path("/users/log-in")                 # current locale
      Routes.path("/users/log-in", locale: "et")   # /et/users/log-in
      Routes.path("/sitemap.xml", locale: :none)   # never localized

  Note that the primary language is emitted prefixlessly when the site is
  configured that way, so `locale: "en"` on an English-primary site yields a
  path with no `/en` segment — that is deliberate, not a dropped option.

  See the multilang guide for how locales are resolved and switched; the symptom
  of getting this wrong (English auth pages on a translated site) reads like an
  i18n bug rather than a routing one.
