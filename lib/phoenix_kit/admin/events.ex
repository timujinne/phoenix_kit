  ## Unsubscription Functions
  #
  # These three exist because a subscription can outlive the permission that
  # justified it: `/admin` is the landing page EVERY authenticated visitor can
  # reach, and an operator sitting on it whose rights are revoked mid-session
  # must stop receiving the operator feeds without a reload.
  #
  # There is no generic escape hatch for a caller to do this itself.
  # `Phoenix.PubSub.unsubscribe/2` needs the PubSub server name, and PhoenixKit
  # runs its OWN instance (`PhoenixKit.PubSub.Manager`, `:phoenix_kit_internal_pubsub`)
  # rather than the host's — the name and the topic strings are both private to
  # this layer. So the counterpart to a `subscribe_to_*/0` has to live here too.
  #
  # Only the three topics the dashboard overview joins are covered; add the
  # matching pair, not a bare `unsubscribe/1`, if another topic ever needs one.
