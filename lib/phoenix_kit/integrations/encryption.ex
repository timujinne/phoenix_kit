defmodule PhoenixKit.Integrations.Encryption do
  @moduledoc """
  AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive integration credentials.

  Encrypts fields like `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `client_secret`,
  `api_key`, `bot_token`, `secret_key`, `password` before storing in the
  database. Decrypts them when reading.

  ## Key resolution

  The AES key is derived (SHA-256) from a secret, tried in this order:

    1. **Dedicated key** — `config :phoenix_kit, :integrations_encryption_key`.
       The recommended setup: a random secret independent of anything else
       in the app, generated with `mix phoenix_kit.integrations.rotate_key`
       and wired from an environment variable in `runtime.exs`, e.g.

           config :phoenix_kit,
             integrations_encryption_key: System.get_env("PHOENIX_KIT_INTEGRATIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY")

    2. **Legacy fallback** — the application's `secret_key_base` (flat
       `config :phoenix_kit, :secret_key_base`, or the host app's own
       Endpoint secret). This is what every install used before the
       dedicated key existed, and it stays supported for backwards
       compatibility — but it means anyone who can read `secret_key_base`
       (env, config file, git history) can decrypt every stored integration
       credential, since that secret is shared with session signing, CSRF
       tokens, and everything else Phoenix derives from it. `status/0`
       reports this tier as `:legacy_secret_key_base`. `mix phoenix_kit.doctor`
       and the admin-only system page always surface it; a boot-time log line
       is also available (see `warn_if_insecure/0`) but OFF by default — set
       `config :phoenix_kit, integration_encryption_warn_on_boot: true` to
       have `PhoenixKit.boot/1` log it on every restart. That flag governs
       the boot report for every install where encryption works (the legacy
       key above, and key-store problems under a dedicated key). When
       credentials are stored as plaintext (`:disabled_no_key`,
       `:disabled_explicit`) the report is logged unless the flag is set to
       an explicit `false`, which also silences the one-time warning on the
       first plaintext write. Unless the flag is an explicit `false`,
       `boot/1` resolves the key to learn which state the install is in, so
       the one-time error "a key store IS configured but its secret could not
       be read" may appear at boot even when the report itself is off. Only
       the boolean `false` silences: the string `"false"` (for example from
       `System.get_env/1`) is truthy and turns the full report on.

  Set `config :phoenix_kit, integration_encryption_enabled: false` to turn
  encryption off entirely (new and existing writes store plaintext). This is
  reported as `:disabled_explicit` by `status/0` and is warned about at boot
  unless `integration_encryption_warn_on_boot: false` is set as well.

  > #### Key rotation {: .warning}
  > Changing which secret produces the key — setting a dedicated key for the
  > first time, or rotating an existing one — makes every existing `enc:v1:`
  > value undecryptable under the new key. There is no dual-key fallback at
  > read time (that would silently mask a misconfigured key with plaintext
  > read failures, the opposite of the point). Use
  > `PhoenixKit.Integrations.KeyRotation.rotate/2` (or
  > `mix phoenix_kit.integrations.rotate_key`) to re-encrypt every stored
  > connection under the new secret BEFORE switching the app's config over
  > to it.
  >
  > A field that's temporarily undecryptable (mismatched key, mid-rotation)
  > is never permanently lost by an unrelated write in the meantime — see
  > `decrypt_fields_with_failures/1` and
  > `PhoenixKit.Integrations.save_setup/4`'s write path. The stored

  The verdict for a set of signals — total over the signal space.

  Public because the acceptance criterion here is an enumeration: every
  combination rendered whole and read for self-contradiction. That needs a seam
  that takes the state rather than discovering it.

  ## Ordered by the tier first, and deliberately

  Three rounds ordered the clauses by fault — unreadable store, then short key,
  then tier — and each round found a state where the fault clause fired over a
  tier that was working, and announced a fallback that was not happening. The
  fix each time was to move one clause; the next round found the next one.

  The tier is the ground truth: it is *which key is protecting the data right
  now*. A fault is a modifier on that, never a replacement for it. So the tier
  is matched first and the fault second, which has two consequences worth
  stating:

    * no combination of signals can produce a report claiming a fallback while
      the signals say a dedicated key is in use — not because that combination
      is argued to be unreachable, but because no clause can say it;
    * the verdict is **total**. Every point in the signal space renders, and the
      test walks all of them rather than filtering by a reachability rule.
      Reachability rules were themselves the defect twice: they were reasoned
      out by whoever reasoned out the code, and they excluded states the code
      could actually reach.

  Within a tier, the faults are ordered by which one an operator must clear
  first. For the weaker tiers a rejected key outranks an unreadable store,
  because `dedicated_candidate/2` never consults the store while config answers
  — so repairing the store cannot change anything until the short key is gone.

  A short, non-reversible fingerprint of the key currently in use, or `:none`.

  Exists so that **key reuse between sites is visible**. `derive_key/1` is a
  plain SHA-256 over the secret, so two installs that share a `secret_key_base`
  — copied from a template, cloned from a sibling environment, inherited with a
  `config/dev.exs` — derive a byte-identical integration key and neither has any
  way to notice. One compromise then exposes every site that shares it.

  Two installs showing the same fingerprint are using the same key.

  ## Comparing two numbers only means something like-for-like

  Three things make one site show a fingerprint that is not "its" key, and none
  of them are visible in the number itself, so **always read the tier printed
  next to it**:

    * an unreadable key store, so the fallback key is being fingerprinted;
    * a dedicated key rejected as too short, same effect;
    * encryption disabled, in which case there is no fingerprint at all.

  There is also an environment trap. `mix phoenix_kit.doctor` resolves the key
  in the **task's** environment; a key delivered by an env var read in
  `runtime.exs` may differ from what the running server holds. A task and an
  admin page on the same site can therefore disagree. Compare admin page with
  admin page, or task with task.

  ## What it gives away

  Domain-separated from `derive_key/1` and truncated, so it is not the key and
  cannot be turned back into one. It IS a verifier: anyone holding it can test
  candidate secrets offline.

  There is no salt, and there cannot be one — a per-install salt would make two
  installs with the same key show different numbers, destroying the only thing
  this is for. What can be raised is the cost per guess, so the digest is
  iterated (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, #{@fingerprint_iterations} iterations) instead
  of the two plain hashes it used to be. The prefix is global to PhoenixKit, so
  a table over common `secret_key_base` values works against every install at
  once; iteration makes building that table that many times more expensive, and
  nothing more. **The fingerprint is no stronger than the secret behind it** —
  against a weak, guessable secret it is a verification oracle, which is exactly
  the situation this feature exists to surface.

  Accordingly it is shown on the admin-only system page, and by
  `mix phoenix_kit.doctor` only when explicitly asked for: a task's output ends
  up in CI logs, whose readership is wider than the page's.

  Logs a warning when integration credentials are not protected by a

  `:dedicated` case; the common, correctly-configured install must produce
  zero noise here.

  This function itself is unconditional — every call evaluates `key_report/0`
  and logs if it isn't `:ok`. What's opt-in is *who calls it at boot*:
  `PhoenixKit.boot/1` invokes it when
  `config :phoenix_kit, integration_encryption_warn_on_boot: true` is set
  (unset by default), since otherwise every install still on the legacy
  `secret_key_base` fallback would get this log line on every single restart
  with no way to quiet it. The exception is plaintext storage
  (`status/0` is `:disabled_no_key` or `:disabled_explicit`): `boot/1` calls
  this function in that case too, unless the flag is an explicit `false`.
  Unless the flag is an explicit `false` (then `boot/1` skips the check
  and does not resolve the key at all), `boot/1` resolves the key to learn
  the state, so the one-time error "a key store IS configured but its
  secret could not be read" may be logged at boot even when this report is
  not. `mix phoenix_kit.doctor`
  and the admin-only system page render `key_report/0` directly, independent
  of this flag, so the diagnosis is always available on demand even when the
  boot push is off.

  An `:integrations_encryption_key` shorter than the minimum length gets
  its OWN message rather than being folded into the "no dedicated key"
  wording below — an operator who set one, just too short, needs
  different advice than one who never set it, and telling them "no

  # environment, got a different answer, and announced "NO key resolved at all"
  # directly above a fingerprint of the key that had in fact resolved. A value
  # rendered from a state must not consult anything outside that state.

  # tier resolution, so asking for one would recurse", and it inferred the

  # to the secret_key_base-derived key" — the same false fallback claim this
  # module has now had removed from four other surfaces, sitting in the one
