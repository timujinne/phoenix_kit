  Test fixtures and session helpers for host applications.

  ## Why this ships

  Every host was writing the same four helpers, and the hand-rolled login was
  subtly wrong: it set `:user_token` but not `:live_socket_id`, so LiveView's
  disconnect-on-logout never fired and a session-invalidation test was the only
  thing that would ever have caught it. That is a worse outcome than
  duplication, and it is what a shipped helper fixes.

  ## What is deliberately NOT here

  No `ConnCase`, no `DataCase`, no `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox` calls. Those are
  bound to *your* endpoint and *your* repo, and a copy compiled in the kit's
  context could not adapt to either. Sandbox ownership stays yours. Everything
  here is portable: the fixtures go through `Auth.register_user/1`, which uses
  the configured repo, and the session helpers only put keys into a conn.

  ## Confirmed vs unconfirmed — read the test, do not memorise a default

  `user_fixture/1` produces an **unconfirmed** user, honestly mirroring what
  `register_user/1` does. Confirmation flips authentication behaviour, so a
  fixture that silently confirmed would leave a reader of

      user = user_fixture()

  unable to tell why a redirect gate did or did not fire. Ask for
  `confirmed_user_fixture/1` when you mean confirmed.

  (`confirmed_at == nil` after registration is correct, not a defect being
  papered over: `registration_changeset/3` refuses to cast it, confirmation is
  its own transition, and the gate exists precisely to handle the
  registered-but-unconfirmed state — so tests have to be able to produce it.)

  ## Usage

      defmodule MyAppWeb.AdminTest do
        use MyAppWeb.ConnCase
        import PhoenixKit.Test.Fixtures

        test "an admin reaches the dashboard", %{conn: conn} do
          %{conn: conn} = register_and_log_in_user(%{conn: conn})
          assert conn |> get(~p"/phoenix_kit/admin") |> html_response(200)
        end
      end
