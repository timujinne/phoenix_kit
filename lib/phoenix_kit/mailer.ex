defmodule PhoenixKit.Mailer do
  @moduledoc """
  Mailer module for PhoenixKit emails.

  This module handles sending emails such as
  confirmation emails, password reset emails, magic link emails, etc.

  It can work in two modes:
  1. **Built-in mode**: Uses PhoenixKit's own Swoosh mailer (default)
  2. **Delegation mode**: Uses the parent application's mailer when configured

  ## Configuration

  To use your application's mailer instead of PhoenixKit's built-in one:

      config :phoenix_kit,
        mailer: MyApp.Mailer

  When delegation is configured, all emails will be sent through your application's
  mailer, allowing you to use a single mailer configuration across your entire application.

  # Soft dependency: the optional `emails` package (not a dependency of

  #
  # We deliberately call `check_blocklist/1`, NOT `check_limits/1`:
  # `check_limits/1` additionally enforces the emails module's per-recipient
  # (100/h) and GLOBAL (10_000/h) send caps, which are not gated by any
  # enable flag. Wiring those in here would silently throttle every outbound
  # email app-wide (auth mail included) and would cap bulk newsletter
  # broadcasts at 10k/hour. Send pacing/quotas belong to the newsletters

  Where an outgoing message will actually be sent, resolved the same way
  `deliver_email/2` resolves it: the operator's default send integration wins,
  then the delegated host mailer (`config :phoenix_kit, :mailer`), then the
  built-in one. The adapter element is `nil` when the resolved mailer has no
  adapter configured.

  `PhoenixKit.Config.mailer_local?/0` derives from this — anything that needs
  to know "does mail land in the local dev mailbox?" must go through one of
  the two, never through a raw config read (issue #687: the raw read answered
  for a mailer that may not be the one sending, in both directions).

  For a delegated mailer the adapter is read from
  `PhoenixKit.Config.get_parent_app/0`'s env, which assumes that app matches
  the mailer's own `:otp_app` — the same assumption the SES detection in
  delivery has always made. Set `:parent_app_name` explicitly if they differ.

  Sends an email using a template from the database.

  This is the main function for sending emails using PhoenixKit's template system.
  It automatically:
  - Loads the template by name
  - Renders it with provided variables
  - Tracks template usage
  - Sends the email with tracking
  - Logs to EmailSystem

  ## Parameters

  - `template_name` - Name of the template in the database (e.g., "welcome_email")
  - `recipient` - Email address (string) or {name, email} tuple
  - `variables` - Map of variables to substitute in the template
  - `opts` - Additional options:
    - `:user_uuid` - Associate email with a user (for tracking)
    - `:campaign_id` - Campaign identifier (for analytics)
    - `:from` - Override from address (default: configured from_email)
    - `:reply_to` - Reply-to address
    - `:metadata` - Additional metadata map for tracking

  ## Returns

  - `{:ok, email}` - Email sent successfully
  - `{:error, :template_not_found}` - Template doesn't exist
  - `{:error, :template_inactive}` - Template is not active
  - `{:error, reason}` - Other error

  Delivers an email using the appropriate mailer.

  If Settings key `"default_email_integration_uuid"` is set and resolves to
  an Integrations connection with valid credentials, delivery is routed
  through that connection via `deliver_via_integration/3` (set on the core
  Email Sending settings page). Otherwise, if a parent application mailer is
  configured, delegates to it; failing that, uses the built-in PhoenixKit
  mailer. The setting being absent, blank, or pointing at a
  deleted/unconfigured connection is a no-op — behavior is unchanged from
  before this routing existed.

  This function also integrates with the email tracking system to log
  outgoing emails when tracking is enabled. Recipients blocklisted by the
  emails module (hard bounces, complaints, manual blocks — in `to`, `cc` or
  `bcc`) are rejected before any tracking or delivery is attempted; see
  `check_recipient_allowed/1`. Send-rate limits are deliberately NOT enforced
  here — see the soft-dependency note at the top of this module.

  ## Return shape

  Normally the adapter's own `{:ok, metadata}` (metadata shape is adapter
  specific — `%{id: message_id}` for most). When an email provider takes the
  message over for later delivery (`maybe_enqueue/2`), the result is instead
  `{:ok, %{id: ref, queued: true}}`, where `ref` identifies the queued message,
  not a message id from a relay that has not seen it yet. Callers that only
  match `{:ok, _}` are unaffected; a caller that needs the message sent on this
  process can pass `skip_queue: true`.

  When the resolved transport is the local dev mailbox and the
  `dev_mailbox_enabled` setting is off (its default — see issue #687), the
  message is written to the server log instead of being handed to any adapter,
  and the result is `{:ok, %{id: "dev-mailbox-suppressed", suppressed: true}}`.
  It reads as success on purpose — auth flows must not error over a dev-only
  transport — but no mail was sent and nothing was recorded by tracking.

  Delivers an email via a specific Integrations connection (AWS SES,
  universal SMTP, or Brevo API), selected by the connection's `uuid`.

  Unlike `deliver_email/2`, this does **not** go through
  `deliver_with_runtime_config/2` — that path is hardcoded to AWS SES
  (`config[:adapter] == Swoosh.Adapters.AmazonSES`, credentials only from
  `Provider.current().get_aws_*`), so a Brevo or SMTP send routed through
  it would be misrouted or ignored. This function resolves the Swoosh
  adapter and config directly from the chosen integration's stored
  credentials instead, while preserving the same interception seam
  `deliver_email/2` uses so tracking keeps working.

  ## Returns

  - `{:ok, term()}` — delivered
  - `{:error, {:blocked, atom()}}` — a recipient (`to`/`cc`/`bcc`) is
    blocklisted by the emails module (checked before the integration is even
    resolved). Send-rate limits are NOT enforced here — see the module's
    soft-dependency note.
  - `{:error, :not_configured | :deleted}` — the integration uuid didn't resolve
  - `{:error, {:incomplete_credentials, [String.t()]}}` — the connection's
    `status` says connected, but a required field (e.g. SMTP `host`, SES
    `aws_region`) is blank — most likely edited after the last successful
    validation. Listed field names are the credential keys, never values.
  - `{:error, {:unsupported_provider, String.t()} | :unsupported_provider}` —
    the integration's provider has no known Swoosh adapter mapping (the bare
    atom when the credentials carry no provider key at all)
  - `{:error, {:invalid_smtp_port, term()}}` — the SMTP connection's port is
    not a number
  - `{:error, {:invalid_security | :invalid_verify_cert | :invalid_auth |
    :invalid_timeout, term()}}` / `{:error, :invalid_ca_cert}` — SMTP only: one
    of the operator's transport settings does not parse. Unknown values are
    refused rather than coerced back to the default, so a typo can't silently
    downgrade the connection's encryption
  - `{:error, :no_ca_store}` — SMTP only, and a **behaviour change**: there is no
    system CA bundle, so the relay's certificate cannot be verified and the
    password would go out to an unauthenticated server. Sending stops. It used to
    proceed with `verify: :verify_none`, which is why slim images (distroless,
    scratch, some Alpine builds) never noticed they had no CA store. Install one
    (e.g. `ca-certificates`) to restore sending. A relay with no credentials to
    protect still degrades rather than failing.
