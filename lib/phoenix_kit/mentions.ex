defmodule PhoenixKit.Mentions do
  @moduledoc """
  Cross-module `@` pings and `#` record links.

  Typing `@` anywhere a person can write free text offers people; typing `#`
  offers records from every installed module. The picked result is stored as
  a self-contained token (`PhoenixKit.Mentions.Token`), indexed for reverse
  lookup (`PhoenixKit.Mentions.Mention`), and rendered per viewer.

  ## The three halves

    * **Search** — `search/2` fans out across every module that declares a
      searchable resource type, in parallel, with a hard deadline. A module
      that is slow, raises, or has no index costs its own results and
      nothing else: the popup shows what came back.

    * **Resolve** — reuses `PhoenixKit.ResourceLinks`, which already turns
      `(type, uuid)` into a title and a deep-link for the Activity feed and
      Comments. Batched per type, so a page of mentions costs one call per
      distinct type, not one per mention.

    * **Visibility** — `visible/3` asks each type's handler which of these
      uuids THIS viewer may see. Separate from resolution on purpose: the
      searcher and the later reader are different people, and a record that
      was visible when it was linked may not be when it is read.

  ## What a viewer sees

  | Situation | Rendered as |
  |---|---|
  | Resolves, viewer may see it | live title, real deep-link |
  | Gone, or its module uninstalled | the author's stored label, plain text |
  | Exists, viewer may NOT see it | a redacted chip — never the title |

  The middle row is why the label lives in the text. The bottom row is the
  rule that matters: a mention must never show a viewer a title they are not
  allowed to know, and it must never *refresh* one. What it does show is
  that something is there — the Discord model — with a way to ask for
  access, because "you can't see this" is only useful with a next step.

  ## Making a module's records mentionable

  Add the type to `resource_links/0` pointing at a handler module, then give
  that handler two functions beyond the `resolve_comment_resources/1` it
  already needs for Activity and Comments:

      defmodule MyApp.Widgets.Links do
        # Already required for deep-linking in Activity/Comments
        def resolve_comment_resources(uuids), do: %{...}

        # New: the `#` typeahead. MUST scope to the searcher.
        def search_resources(query, opts) do
          user_uuid = opts[:user_uuid]
          ...
          [%{type: "widget", uuid: w.uuid, title: w.name, subtitle: "Widget"}]
        end

        # New: which of these may this viewer see? Batched.
        def visible_resource_uuids(uuids, opts), do: [...]
      end

  A handler without `search_resources/2` is resolvable but not offerable —
  reasonable for a type that should be linkable from an activity row yet
  never suggested by the typeahead.

  `visible_resource_uuids/2` is what makes a type mentionable at all.
  Without it, a mention of that type renders REDACTED, because a token can
  be typed by hand into any textarea and "the module didn't implement the
  check" must never mean "show it to everyone". The only exception is
  `user`: the `@` typeahead already lists every pingable account to anyone
  who can reach the admin area, so a name is not something a mention can
  leak.

  Delivers the `@` pings among `mentions` and marks them sent.

  Call it with what `sync/4` returned — those are the ones that are new.
  Everything else is filtered here rather than by the caller:

    * `#` links never notify. Telling a record's watchers it was referenced
      is a different product (and a noisy one); the reverse index is enough
      to build a "mentioned in" panel when that is actually wanted.
    * mentioning yourself does nothing.
    * someone who cannot open the containing record is not told about it.
      An email about a comment that 403s on click is worse than silence.

  Delivery itself is core's activity → notification bridge, so a ping lands
  wherever that person already reads things and obeys their existing
  preferences and channels.
