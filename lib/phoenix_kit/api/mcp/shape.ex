  How tools, results and errors look on MCP.

  The `version` argument is the protocol revision of the request
  (`MCP-Protocol-Version`, `2025-03-26` when the header is absent). What a
  revision gets is its profile in `PhoenixKit.API.MCP.Versions`: `title`,
  `outputSchema` and `structuredContent` exist from `2025-06-18` on, and a
  client of the older revision gets text only.

  The root of `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` is always sent as an object
  (MCP requires it and the executor accepts only an object); the rest of a
  schema is passed through as declared and `PhoenixKit.API.ToolLint` is what
  checks that it is sound.
