defmodule Mix.Tasks.Compile.PhoenixKitJsSources do
  @moduledoc """
  Mix compiler that vendors PhoenixKit's JS hooks into the host app.

  This compiler keeps two vendored files current on **every** `mix compile`:

  1. `priv/static/assets/vendor/phoenix_kit.js` — a straight copy of
     PhoenixKit's own core hooks file. Previously this was only copied once,
     by `mix phoenix_kit.install`/`mix phoenix_kit.update` (`File.cp/2` in
     `PhoenixKit.Install.JsIntegration`) — a deploy that does `rm -rf
     priv/static` + rebuild without re-running `phoenix_kit.update` (i.e. most
     CI/CD pipelines) shipped a 404 on this file, silently breaking every
     PhoenixKit JS hook. Vendoring it from a compiler makes it self-healing:
     it comes back on the next `mix compile`, with zero dependency on
     `phoenix_kit.update` ever having run again after install.
  2. `priv/static/assets/vendor/phoenix_kit_modules.js` — external modules
     declare prebuilt hook bundles via `js_sources/0` (see `PhoenixKit.Module`);
     this compiler discovers them via `PhoenixKit.ModuleDiscovery`, resolves
     each bundle's absolute path via `:code.priv_dir/1` (works for Hex installs
     and path deps alike), and concatenates them (each wrapped in an IIFE so
     their top-level scopes can't collide) into this file, followed by a merge
     that folds each bundle's `window.<Global>` into `window.PhoenixKitHooks`
     (which the host spreads into `LiveSocket`).

  Both writes are diffed against the existing file first, so a `mix compile`
  that changes nothing doesn't touch either file (avoids live-reload thrash).

  The two `<script>` tags are **stable**: adding or removing a JS-bearing
  module only changes `phoenix_kit_modules.js`'s content on the next compile —
  never the host's layout — so it stays zero-config like `css_sources/0`.

  ## Setup (one-time, by `mix phoenix_kit.install`)

      # mix.exs
      compilers: [:phoenix_kit_js_sources, :phoenix_live_view] ++ Mix.compilers()

      # root.html.heex, before app.js
      <script src={~p"/assets/vendor/phoenix_kit.js"}></script>
      <script src={~p"/assets/vendor/phoenix_kit_modules.js"}></script>

  Failures are loud: a missing core JS file (corrupted/incomplete dependency
  fetch) or a declared module bundle that can't be resolved raises a compile
  error rather than silently shipping "unknown hook" console errors.

  ## This is a fast path, not the only way

  It used to be the only way, on the reasoning that a hook had to be in the
  host's single `LiveSocket` at construction time because a nested LiveView
  could not register one at runtime. That stopped being true in LiveView 1.1:
  `getHookDefinition/1` resolves a hook name when its element mounts, and falls
  back to a `script[data-phx-runtime-hook="Name"]` in the document whose
  `window.phx_hook_<Name>()` returns the callbacks. LiveView re-creates such a
  script when a patch adds it, so it works on a page delivered over the socket
  as well as in the first HTML.

  A module can therefore ship its hooks itself and ask nothing of the host —
  `phoenix_kit_boards` does, after two releases where `js_sources/0` alone
  silently delivered nothing to hosts that bundle dependency JS their own way.
  The host's own registration still wins (`getHookDefinition` checks
  `liveSocket.hooks` first), so the two never collide and this compiler stays
  the cheaper path where it is set up.

  What it must not be is a *silent* requirement. `PhoenixKitWeb.Integration`
  warns at compile time when installed modules declare `js_sources/0` and this
  compiler is absent from the host's `:compilers` — the state where those
  modules' hooks are never delivered, no error appears anywhere, and only the
  feature is missing.
